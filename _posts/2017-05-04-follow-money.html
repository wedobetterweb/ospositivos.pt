  <blockquote> Every time we went to the supermarket, my mom would give me a quarter to  play Pac Man. As a good socialist kid, I thought the goal of the game was to  help Pac Man, who was stranded in a maze and needed to find his friends, who  were looking for him.<br>
    My games didn't last very long. The correct way to play Pac Man, of course,  is to consume as much as possible while running from the ghosts that  relentlessly pursue you. This was a valuable early lesson in what it means to  be an American.<br>
    <strong>It also taught me that technology and ethics aren't so easy to separate,  and that if you want to know how a system works, it helps to follow the money. </strong><br>

  <p>A propósito  de tópicos mais militantes, mas os <em>artsy-designers</em> que gostam de  <em>&quot;fanzinar&quot;</em> e ainda têm um desdém snob ao digital fariam bem em ler um  outro artigo já antiguinho deste senhor: <b><em><a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm" target="_blank">&quot;Web Design: The First 100 Years&quot;</a></em></b> <sup>2014</sup>. Vão descobrir em vocês um novo amor no  digital e uma vontade de criar nesses domínios. <em>Give it a try, will ya?</em>

Se és um romântico do papel, és um romântico, ponto. E o texto tem o potencial de vos obrigar repensar o vosso posicionamento ao digital: há o sério perigo de começares a ser um romântico das novas tecnologias se este for o teu primeiro contacto à evolução do web design, mesmo se esse é o título do artigo mas em momento algum se trate desse. </p>
  
  <div class="info coluna centre"><p><b><em><a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm" target="_blank">&quot;Web Design: The First 100 Years&quot;</a></em></b></p>
  </div>
  <p><small>Todas as  notas merecem leitura e reflexão, e há duas anunciadas que não se encontram disponíveis,  mas seriam bastante proveitosas às nossas teses:&nbsp;<em><b>&quot;Notes on  Decentralization&quot;</b></em>, cujo tema parece-nos óbvio, e o <em><b>&quot;Remember The  Web?&quot;</b></em> a propósito de <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/03/digital-over-lasting.html">arquivos digitais</a>.</small></p>
  <p>E porque estamos sintonizados naquelas coisas dos três, uma para arquivo:</p>
 <blockquote>
  <ul class="lista">
    <li>Vision 1: CONNECT KNOWLEDGE, PEOPLE, AND CATS.<br>
      This is the correct vision.<br>
      </li>
    <li>Vision 2: FIX THE WORLD WITH SOFTWARE<br>
      This is the prevailing vision in Silicon Valley. <br>
      </li>
    <li>Vision 3: BECOME AS GODS, IMMORTAL CREATURES OF PURE ENERGY LIVING IN A CRYSTALLINE PARADISE OF OUR OWN CONSTRUCTION<br>
      This is the insane vision. I'm a little embarrassed to talk about it, because it's so stupid. But circumstances compel me.</li>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Fora o  <em>arsty</em>, de onde essas conclusões introduzem à militância e continuamos destas em seguida.</p>
  <blockquote> When I talk about a hundred years of web design,<b> I mean it as a challenge</b>.  There's no law that says that things are guaranteed to keep getting better.<br>
    The web we have right now is beautiful. It shatters the tyranny of  distance. It opens the libraries of the world to you. It gives you a way to  bear witness to people half a world away, in your own words. It is full of  cats. We built it by accident, yet already we're taking it for granted. <b>We  should fight to keep it!</b><br>

<p><em>Fastforward</em> para o presente e os românticos ficam por aqui.  Do  enquadramento às nossas teses:</p>

  <div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> As  Upton Sinclair said, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something,  when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” </div>
  <blockquote> A question few are asking is whether the tools of mass surveillance and  social control we spent the last decade building could have had anything to do  with the debacle of the 2017 election, or whether destroying local journalism  and making national journalism so dependent on our platforms was, in  retrospect, a good idea.
    But admitting that this tool of social control might be conducive to  authoritarianism is not something we&rsquo;re ready to face. After all, we're good  people. <strong>We like freedom. How could we have built tools that subvert it?</strong><br>
  <small>in <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/build_a_better_monster.htm" target="_blank"><em>&quot;Morality, Machine Learning, and Mass Surveillance&quot;</em></a> <sup>18 abr 2017</sup></small>  </blockquote>
  <p><em>Surveillance  Capitalism</em>, de que falamos <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/03/new-money-lots-holes.html">aqui</a>.</p>
  <blockquote> The economic basis of the Internet is surveillance. Every interaction with  a computing device leaves a data trail, and whole industries exist to consume  this data. Unlike dystopian visions from the past, this surveillance is not  just being conducted by governments or faceless corporations. Instead, it&rsquo;s the  work of a small number of sympathetic tech companies with likable founders,  whose real dream is to build robots and Mars rockets and do cool things that  make the world better. Surveillance just pays the bills.<br>
  It is a striking fact that mass surveillance has been driven almost  entirely by private industry. While the Snowden revelations in 2012 made people  anxious about government monitoring, that anxiety never seemed to carry over to  the much more intrusive surveillance being conducted by the commercial  Internet.  <br>
  <small>in <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/build_a_better_monster.htm" target="_blank"><em>&quot;Morality, Machine Learning, and Mass Surveillance&quot;</em></a> <sup>18 abr 2017</sup></small>  </blockquote>
  <p>E os suspeitos habituais:</p>
  <blockquote> Two companies in particular dominate the world of online advertising and  publishing, the economic engines of the surveillance economy.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Google</b>: (...) the world&rsquo;s de facto email server (...), a dominant position  in almost every area of online life. Through initiatives like AMP (advanced  mobile pages), the company is attempting to extend its reach so that it becomes  a proxy server <sup>(*)</sup> for much of online publishing. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Facebook</b>: (...) world&rsquo;s largest photo storage service, and owns the world&rsquo;s  largest messaging service, WhatsApp. (...) The tool of choice for political  outreach and organizing, event planning, fundraising and communication, (...)  the primary source of news, (...) and through its feed algorithm (...) has an  unparalleled degree of editorial control over what that news looks like.<br>
    <br>
    These companies exemplify the centralized, feudal Internet of 2017. While  the protocols that comprise the Internet remain open and free, in practice a  few large American companies dominate every aspect of online life. Google  controls search and email, <b>AWS</b> controls cloud hosting, <b>Apple</b> and Google  have a duopoly in mobile phone operating systems. Facebook is the one social  network.<br>

  <p><em>Data Hunger (and no Games)</em></p>
  <blockquote> <b>The one thing these companies share is an insatiable appetite for data  (...) and anything else they can discover.</b>
    <p>      There are<b> two interlocking motives</b> for this data hunger: to <b>target online  advertising</b>, and to <b>train machine learning algorithms</b>.</p>
These, then, are<b> the twin pillars of the online economy.</b> We have an  apparatus for harvesting tremendous quantities of data from people, and a set  of effective but opaque learning algorithms we train on this data. The  algorithms learn to show people the things they are most likely to &lsquo;engage&rsquo;  with—click, share, view, and react to. We make them very good at provoking  these reactions from people. This is our sixty billion dollar industry.<br>
    <small>in <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/build_a_better_monster.htm" target="_blank"><em>&quot;Morality, Machine Learning, and Mass Surveillance&quot;</em></a> <sup>18 abr 2017</sup></small>      </blockquote>
    <div class="info coluna">
      <blockquote>
        <h3>So what happens when these tools for maximizing clicks and  engagement creep into the political sphere? </h3>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
  <p>Do algoritmos:</p>
  <blockquote> Failure modes become important when we start using machine learning to  manipulate human beings. The learning algorithms have no ethics or boundaries.  There&rsquo;s no slot in the algorithm that says &ldquo;insert moral compass here&rdquo;, or any  way to tell them that certain inferences are forbidden because they would be  wrong.<br>

  <p>Do <b>$$$:</b></p>
  <blockquote> Whatever bright line we imagine separating commerce from politics is not  something the software that runs these sites can see. All the algorithms know  is what they measure, which is the same for advertising as it is in politics:  engagement, time on site, who shared what, who clicked what, and who is likely  to come back for more.<br>
  <small>in <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/build_a_better_monster.htm" target="_blank"><em>&quot;Morality, Machine Learning, and Mass Surveillance&quot;</em></a> <sup>18 abr 2017</sup></small>  </blockquote>
  <p><em>Politics</em>:</p>
  <blockquote> The persuasion works (...) but political sales techniques that maximize  &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; have troubling implications in a democracy. 
      One problem is that any system trying to maximize engagement will try to  push users towards the fringes.<br>
  Things get worse when third parties are allowed to use these algorithms to  target a specific audience.<br>
  <small>in <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/build_a_better_monster.htm" target="_blank"><em>&quot;Morality, Machine Learning, and Mass Surveillance&quot;</em></a> <sup>18 abr 2017</sup></small>  </blockquote>
  <p>Democracia<em> et al:</em></p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> Obviously, in this situation whoever controls the algorithms has great  power. There are no democratic checks or controls on this power, and the people  who exercise it are trying to pretend it doesn’t exist.  </div>
  <blockquote> What you see in your feed is algorithmically tailored to your identity and  your interaction history with the site. No one else gets the same view. This  has troubling implications for democracy, because it moves political  communication that used to be public into a private space. When no two people  see the same thing, it becomes difficult to trace orchestrated attempts to  target people in political campaigns.<br>
  This is an inversion in political life that we haven&rsquo;t seen before.  Conversations between people that used to be private, or semi-private, now take  place on public forums where they are archived forever. Meanwhile, the kind of  political messaging that used to take place in public view is now visible only  to an audience of one.  <br>

  <p>Da privacidade:</p>
  <blockquote> The lingering doubt that anything you say privately can ever truly stay  private.
  A real worry for anyone is that their private lives will be publicized.  Throughout the election, private communications by low-level staffers were  leaked and used as a political weapon. The message was very clear: stay out of  politics. <br>

  <p>Da vigilância, economia da atenção e resistência:</p>
  <blockquote>     Surveillance capitalism makes it harder to organize effective long-term  dissent. In an setting where attention is convertible into money. There will be  no comparable rewards for cooperation, de-escalation, consensus-building, or  compromise, qualities that are essential for the slow work of building a  movement.<br>

  <p>Das autoridades:</p>
  <blockquote>  Powerful people have noted and benefited from the special power of social  media in the political arena. They will not sit by and let programmers  dismantle useful tools for influence and social control. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that  the tech industry considers itself apolitical and rationalist. Powerful people  did not get to be that way by voluntarily ceding power.<br>

  <p>Soluções no imediato:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>    Learning To Forget = to become more ephemeral<br>
    </li>
    <li> Security =&nbsp; predictability. People can better partition their  activity between private, public, and semi-public spaces and use them with  confidence.</li>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>ie, DIY <em>indie</em> distribuído:</p>
  <blockquote>     Above all, people need to have control of their data, a way to carve out  private and semi-private spaces, and a functional public arena for politics and  civil discourse. They also need robust protection from manipulation by  algorithms, well-intentioned or not.<br>

      <b>Break Up  Facebook</b>: iIf dismantling the $60B online advertising industry is not enough, we also  need to break up Facebook. Ideally, we can find a way to have decentralized  social networks, just like we do in real life. But social media cannot be the  major publishing outlet. It cannot simultaneously be the platform for <b>political  organizing, political campaigns, and news delivery</b>. <br>

  </div>
  <p>...e, <em>punx with  an</em> (A)<em>titude</em>, aquilo dos <em><a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2016/12/work-horse.html">jobs</a></em>, que dividimos em - duh- três partes.</p>
  <blockquote> The window of time in which the tech industry can still act is brief:  while tech workers retain relatively high influence in their companies.<br>
  <small>in <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/build_a_better_monster.htm" target="_blank"><em>&quot;Morality, Machine Learning, and Mass Surveillance&quot;</em></a> <sup>18 abr 2017</sup></small>  </blockquote>
  <p>I) Excluíndo outros métodos:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There are very few levers of power over the big tech companies.<br>
      Consumer boycotts don&rsquo;t work. Opting out of a site like Google would mean  opting out of much of online life. Some people could do it on principle, but it  is not something we can mobilize a mass movement around. We can&rsquo;t apply pressure through a system we&rsquo;re trying to abolish, (...)  shareholder pressure doesn&rsquo;t work, (...) regulation is tricky. Press campaigns are unlikely to work because Facebook and Google control  most online publishing. Moreover, what remains of the press has just endured a  painful transition to online advertising, and is wholly dependent on that  business model to survive.<br>

  </blockquote>
  <p>II) O sugerido:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The one effective lever we have against tech companies is <b>employee  pressure</b>. Software engineers are difficult to hire, expensive to train, and  take a long time to replace. Small teams in critical roles (like operations or  security) have the power to shut down a tech company if they act in concert. 
      We&rsquo;ve seen some small demonstrations of the power of employee pressure.  These victories were small, but real. They were achieved by individual  employees organizing informally.<br>

  </blockquote>
  <p>III) e a dificuldade habitual,  que equiparamos ao <em>arsty-fartsy</em> que possui as ferramentas mas nada faz com  elas:</p>
  <blockquote> Unfortunately, the enemy is complacency. Tech workers trust their founders  (...) and are happy to leave larger ethical questions to management. A  workplace free of 'politics' is just one of the many perks the tech industry  offers its pampered employees. So our one chance to enact meaningful change is  slipping away.<br>
