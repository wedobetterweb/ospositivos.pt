  <blockquote><h3>The  historical context <span class="voice">[is]</span> the best way to avoid novelty and linearity biases</h3></blockquote>
  <p>De <a href="https://www.ospositivos.com/2018/03/qual-dos-dois.html">inovações e retrocessos</a> a retrocessos intencionalmente  inovadores, acabadinho de chegar à estampa, faremos desta a introdução à peça que nos fechará ciclo. No percurso histórico que o autor retrata, notamos o cemitério de intenções - quase todas comerciais - que se somam em projectos abandonados, mas também onde o seu estudo se separa mais obviamente das nossas preocupações:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>My focus is  on comics as form, not as a cultural industry. I have  focused on formal innovations, but the necessary return to the social impact of  technology shows that other kinds of innovations generated by digital media  should be considered more carefully, such as the connection to audiences,  readers&rsquo; interactivity and the spreadability of content.<br>

  <p>...ainda que partilhe das mesmas suposições.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>My assumption is that the formal  development of comics is linked to the way technology alters social-economic  practices, but does not necessarily move forward at the same pace.<br>

  <p>Oferece-se uma perspetiva histórica, e essa é boa <em>&quot;precisely&quot;</em> porque <em>&quot;eschews a naive attitude towards technology  and its influence on creative practices&quot;</em>, terminando sobre o momento:</p>

    <p>This  phenomenon clearly seems to point out that we are now coming into a period  where formal innovations linked to digital technologies, as they appeared in  the 1990, are becoming adopted by the communities of creators and users.<br>

  <p>Antes, de velhas  promessas:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The  importance of formal experimentation both in print and digital creation becomes  prominent during the 2000s, but it also carries on the century-old history of  the relationship between comics and technological changes: comics is always in  dialogue with technological changes in visual culture.</p>
    <p>Born on  print, and perhaps even from print, comics have been driven to question their  secular attachment to material print formats, in order to interrogate the  possibilities for a transition, perhaps even a transfer, to digital  distribution.</p>
    <p><span class="voice">[Éric  Maigre]</span> Comics appeared as part of &lsquo;widespread artistic experiments within the  context of media industrialization,&rsquo; hence within an environment where &lsquo;there  cannot be any definitive definition of what comics are, since something  innovative can appear at any time and challenge established canons&rsquo;</p>
    <p><b>This leads  us to consider a process that can go in various directions at the same time.</b><br>

  <p>O retrato histórico que se segue é baseado na realidade  francesa mas fora as referências a projectos idos na década de '90  encontramos percursos aproximados <a href="https://www.ospositivos.com/2018/03/20-anos-de-carneiro.html">entre outras paragens</a>. Saltando a conclusões:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The article  defines<b> three phases</b> for the meeting of digital technology and artistic  practices: <sup>1)</sup> a first, highly innovative phase, <sup>2)</sup> a second phase of appropriation  marked by an endurance of old forms, <sup>3)</sup> a third phase of progressive integration  of innovations.</p>
    <p><sup>1.</sup> The very  first digital comics created during the 1990s are in many ways more innovative  with form than most of the digital comics of the late 2010s.</p>
    <p>The  narrative  emphasizes the novelty of digital comics often used in  marketing departments as a selling point. This emphasis on formal innovation is  also a recurring feature in scholarly discourses. </p>
    <p><sup>2.</sup> The odd experimentation aside, the fact remains  that the dominant aesthetics in digital comics from 2005 to 2009 is that of the  &lsquo;scan&rsquo;, &lsquo;creation under the print paradigm&rsquo;. The  description of creative potentialities was not immediately taken up by  cartoonists in their works <span class="voice">[and]</span> the integration of formal innovations linked  to new technologies in the production of comics did not follow a logic of  progress. It appears clear that authors do not seek out technological  innovations: quite on the contrary, they attempt to get as close as possible to  the standards of print books. </p>
    <p><b>The book  format has an indisputable aura for both authors and readers. In a sense, then,  the desire for formal innovations in comics is already met by print comics.</b><small><sup></sup></small> </p>

    <p><b>$$$</b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> The  mechanisms that underpin the endurance of print forms within digital comics:  the social-economic factor offers a first set of answers. Pre-2000 digital  comics most often benefited from significant financial investments from the  nascent industry of telecommunication and the Internet. Yet, the burst of the  speculative bubble in the early 2000s turned this economic sector into a much  less stable enterprise which downsized the production of technologically  ambitious works.</p>
      <p>Contrastingly,  most works created and distributed online in the 2000s are self-published by  their authors and do not benefit from the same technological environment. They  develop mostly in a non-professionnal or semi-professionnal artists community  who doesn’t seek technological innovation.<br>

    <p><sup>3.</sup> Post-2009 developments to the present day witnesses a resurgence of digital  experimentations, as more and more comics integrate important formal  innovations.<br>

  <p><em><b>Tech talk:  cult listen.</b></em></p>
  <p>Propondo uma explicação ao carrossel de inovações e retrocessos,  o  autor não acusa o processo à maior ou menor resistência de cada frente enquanto  sucesso e insucesso linear histórico, mas enquanto &quot;dialética&quot; normal de adopção de novas  tecnologias.</p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> The most innovative in terms of form is also the older one</div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The  evolution pattern can take multiple directions and unfolds variously in time,  more or less preserving the old media. The shift from invention to innovation  can be pinpointed when old and new forms reach the right equilibrium, considering  their social contexts and the specificity of the distinct media.</p>
    <p>Digital  comics follow a non-linear pattern where the formal persistence of old media is  strong and constitutes the main background against which to understand changes  in the long run. </p>
    <p>Two  distinct processes <span class="voice">[r]</span> at work when we think about technological changes: </p>
    <ul class="lista">
      <li>1) <b>invention</b>: the discovery or development of technology;<br>
      </li>
      <li>2) <b>innovation</b>: a &lsquo;site of convergence&rsquo; between the technological system and the  economic, social, political and institutional systems;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the case  of digital comics, what ranks as invention is the technological system that  feeds into the creation of digital comics (graphics software, tablets, web  technologies, etc.), while innovation designates the ways authors and readers  appropriate these new technologies.</p>
    <p>The history  of technology teaches us that it takes time for inventions to reach widespread  use. It takes a certain time for a technological invention to adapt and become  an innovation, <span class="voice">[ie]</span> <b>socially accepted</b>.<br>
