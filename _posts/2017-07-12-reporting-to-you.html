      <p>How journalism got to this point is less important than what will help it survive in the future. One vision of the future says there must be a necessary separation of journalism from a compromised and opaque system of power that often works as part of the surveillance state, and which has commercial priorities that can clash with the public interest. Whatever the outcome, a larger question remains about the right relationship between journalism and the most powerful companies in the world. This is a long-term issue, which is unlikely to be settled by one group or cartel gaining regulatory concessions but, rather, by a more profound change in the regulatory and commercial environment<br>

    <p><span class="voice">[The] </span>greater threat to America’s news industry: Google and Facebook ’s duopolistic dominance of online advertising. The unique role news media continue to play in American politics and history makes it crucial to ensure a fairer fight for revenue between news publishers and these <b>massive information gateways</b>.</p>
    <p>The problem is that today’s internet distribution systems distort the flow of economic value derived from good reporting. The two digital giants don’t employ reporters: They don’t dig through public records to uncover corruption, send correspondents into war zones, or attend last night’s game to get the highlights. They expect an economically squeezed news industry to do that costly work for them. The only way publishers can address this inexorable threat is by banding together.</p>

    <p>But antitrust laws make such coordination perilous. These laws, intended to prevent monopolies, are having the unintended effect of preserving and protecting Google and Facebook’s dominant position. The digital giants benefit from legal precedent against collective action that has a chilling effect on publishers.<br>

    <p>In seeking the right to negotiate together, the news providers are trying to avoid the trouble that major book publishing houses got into when they worked with Apple to develop an online book rival to Amazon. Without any government clearance, they ran afoul of antitrust laws. Its bid requires legislation giving them specific clearance to negotiate as a group, which is not commonly granted. It’s an especially big ask from a Congress that hasn’t had a great legislative batting average and whose controlling party, the Republicans, is not in a very press-friendly mood these days.<br>

  <blockquote> Monopoly is made by acquisition, at a minimum, these companies should not be allowed to acquire other major firms. The second alternative is to regulate a company like Google as a public utility, requiring it to license out patents, for a nominal fee, for its search algorithms, advertising exchanges and other key innovations. The third alternative is to remove the &quot;safe harbor&quot; clause in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which allows companies like Facebook and Google’s YouTube to free ride on the content produced by others. Removing the safe harbor provision would also force social networks to pay for the content posted on their sites.<br>

  <blockquote> The news media is fractured and weak in the face of Google’s and Facebook’s strength, and journalism, particularly at the local level, has been drained as a result of changes in the market.

  <blockquote> If the News Media Alliance is successful in securing a rarely granted right to negotiate as a group with Google and Facebook,<b> publishers will owe their thanks to Rupert Murdoch</b>.

  <p>Complicando então, dessa frente desunida:</p>

  <blockquote> But the news business is not the homogenous industry it once was, and any move to tackle the dominance of platform companies will highlight differences between legacy media and digital natives rather than unite them. The News Media Alliance does not represent the new generation of digital natives: the Huffington Posts, Breitbarts, BuzzFeeds, and Vox Medias. Nor does it represent other news organizations with vigorous Web presences but roots in broadcasting: CNN, ABC, CBS, and NBC. A number of digitally native publishers contacted about participation in the Alliance had either never heard of it, or had not been asked to join and were not sure they would join if they could.<br>

    <p>At a time when an unusual number of media companies are considering IPOs — including Vice Media, Rovio, and STX Entertainment — they all may find that being in the content business is a knock against them on Wall Street. How BuzzFeed positions its corporate identity will be crucial to its IPO viability. Like a lot of next-generation media companies that are doing things differently from their traditional cohorts, BuzzFeed leans into technology in every aspect of its business, from data to distribution, and doesn’t really identify as a media company per se. Ultimately, revenue is what IPO candidates will be judged by most. Figuring out how to diversify the business beyond ad sales is smart and plays well with Wall Street. Facebook and Google have such a stranglehold on the advertising dollars flowing through the digital space that BuzzFeed is left fighting for scraps, as long as BUZZFEED stays dependent on ad sales, there’s a growth ceiling that isn’t going to reflect well in an IPO phase.<br>
