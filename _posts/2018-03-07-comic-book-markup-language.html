  <p>Acima: um <em>how-to</em> de como criar <em>motion books </em>com a  ferramenta disponibilizada pela <b>Madefire</b>. Não cremos que as gerações de  artistas <i>indy</i> mais imediatas se darão ao trabalho de editar os seus <i>comics</i> como  se de pós-produções audiovisuais se tratassem. Mas <em>hey</em>, quem sabe o quando a BD se vai transformar noutro media nos  próximos 100 anos?</p>
  <p> Olhando para o 100 anteriores, em sentido inverso toda uma  outra proposta que coloca o seu foco na missão arqueológica dos <em>comics</em> como estes surgiram e suporte  onde o fizeram – papel e seus constrangimentos - mas com uma compatibilidade  digital já a imaginar o inevitável futuro. </p>
  <p>    Esta é uma abordagem que goza da nossa preferência em orientações  filosóficas à evolução dos ditos, mas não vos será necessário grande esforço  para compreenderem igual causa de resistência à adoção da mesma: um pequeno eco  das guerras que assolaram os <em>standards</em> no <b>W3C</b> em torno do <b>XHTML</b> e <b>HTML5</b> ressoa por estas sugestões, e qualquer projecto  que não facilite a adoção por leigos e <em>arstys  alike</em> condenada ao fracasso. Recordando do <em>zeitgeist</em>:</p>

      <p> <em><small>A markup language is a set of machine-readable  textual codes, or &quot;tags,&quot; that are used to identify structure,  semantics, and other features of documents and data. The application of these  codes to a document is typically a necessary stage, often the most crucial and  informative stage, of editing, analyzing, indexing publishing, visualizing, and  otherwise studying or manipulating texts in digital environments. The act of  encoding a document is a form of discovery, or prospecting, in which the  encoder maps a document's structure, identifies semantic elements of interest,  and documents relationships internal and external to the document.</small></em><br>

  <blockquote>
    <p> The migration of comics content to digital  reading devices, and the structural and aesthetic implications of that  migration, call attention to the impact of the material characteristics of the  comic book document.</p>
    <p> The structural, textual, visual, and  bibliographic complexity of comic books make them an excellent subject for the  general study of complex documents, especially documents combining pictorial  and textual elements.</p>
    <p> Comic books are exceptionally complex  documents, with intricate relationships between pictorial and textual elements  and a wide variety of content types within a single comic book publication. The  complexity of these documents, their combination of textual and pictorial  elements, and the collaborative nature of their production shares much in  common with other complex documents studied by humanists - illuminated  manuscripts, artists&rsquo; books, illustrated poems, letterpress productions, illustrated  children&rsquo;s books, and even Web pages and other born-digital media.<br>

  <p> Um estudo que não é de modo algum alheio ao livro impresso,  mas capaz de imaginar além desse.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> In light of the ongoing cultural and scholarly  relevance of comics, one goal of CBML is to support the study and analysis of  comic books - even Web pages and other born-digital media. CBML is intended  primarily for representing, modeling, and analyzing twentieth- and  twenty-first-century comic books, daily comic strips, longer narratives or  &quot;graphic novels,&quot; and Web comics and other comics content published  on digital platforms, such as smartphones and tablets. </p>
    <p><b>The emphasis on both  &quot;comics&quot; and &quot;books&quot; in the title of the language signals  an awareness of the full range of content in the material artifact and the  integration of comics content with related paratextual content. The material  properties of the book - the codex form, the leaves and pages, the physical  properties of the paper - are inseparable from the structure, pacing, and design  of the narrative.</b></p>
    <p>      Comic books are often very formally  self-conscious documents and express a fascination with their own bibliographic  identities - creators (comic book writers and artists) become characters in the  narrative, editorial notes refer to episodes from prior issues, comic books and  paratextual elements, such as advertisements, are parodied within the comic  book narrative, publication milestones (such as the first, fiftieth, or one  hundredth issue are highlighted and celebrated. These literary, rhetorical, and  commercial moves point to a self-awareness of the comic book as document and  bibliographic object.<br>

  <blockquote>
    <p> iPhones and other smartphones have become  popular devices for reading newly published comics as well as  &quot;reprints&quot; of older comics. However, a full-page grid of panels is  not easily readable on the smaller screen of the typical smartphone, so the software  interfaces on such devices focus on a single panel at a time. The deliberate  juxtaposition of graphic and textual elements in the original composition is  shattered by the interface requirements and limitations of the reading device.  As new comics work is increasingly targeted at such digital platforms, <b>the traditional grouping of panels into  compositional units resembling pages may be abandoned for new compositional  strategies</b>.<br>

  <p>O re-pensar a bd implica um re-ler desta. De lerBD e <em>schoolars</em> à distância:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> A large corpus of digitized comic books, along  with encoded transcriptions and descriptive metadata, would allow scholars to  search the text of comic books, search for keywords related to topics of  interest, search for the appearance of particular characters, or search for  works by particular writers and artists. Additionally, when exploited to its  full potential, a large CBML collection would allow searching - and other forms  of computer processing and computational analysis - based on structural,  aesthetic, and informational and documentary features peculiar to the genre of  comic books. This sort of functionality has proven incredibly useful and has  transformed the ways in which scholars and students conduct research and  &quot;read.&quot;</p>
    <p> Individual comic books and graphic narratives  may be better understood through strategies of close reading, with careful  attention paid to minute details of linguistic and visual language and document  features, but comic books as a system and extended comic book narratives - which  often unfold over decades in thousands or tens of thousands of individual  documents by hundreds of creators (writers and artists) - benefit also from the  distant reading (of text, image, and metadata) from comic book documents.<br>
