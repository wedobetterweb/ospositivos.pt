  <h3>De estratégias sustentáveis a propósito <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/11/de-dogmas-praticos-e-praticas-dogmaticas.html">de festivais de BD</a> - parte um.</h3>
  <p>Permitam-nos um exemplo - mas temos que dar a volta maior.</p>
  <p>Sobrevivendo ao Apocalipse da <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/06/amazing.html"><b>Amazon</b> <em>on the rise</em></a><em>, &quot;a funny thing happened&quot;: &quot;indie  bookstores staged an unexpected comeback&quot;.</em> E nesse tópico o  registo de um estudo noticiado originalmente na <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/why-independent-bookstores-haved-thrived-in-spite-of-amazon-com" target="_blank">revista da <b><em>Harvard  Business School</em></b></a> <sup>20 nov 2017</sup> <sup>(*)</sup> sobre identidade, comunidade, <em>indies</em>, tecnologia, e livros. </p>
<div class="info coluna">
  <p><small> * Mas <em>worry not</em>,  chega-nos <a href="https://qz.com/1135474/how-independent-bookstores-thrived-in-spite-of-amazon/" target="_blank">via <em><b>Quartz</b></em></a><sup> 26 nov 2017</sup> por terceiros. <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/11/o-monstro-cibernetico-e-grande.html"><em>We-good</em></a>. </small></p>
</div>
  <p> O autor, <em>&quot;assistant professor in the  Organizational Behavior unit&quot;</em> <sup>(*)</sup>, <em>&quot;studies how mature  organizations and industries faced with technological change reinvent  themselves&quot;</em>, <em>&quot;even attended a training course on how to open an independent bookstore&quot;</em> e <em>&quot;began with  his study of the Swiss watch industry, which collectively reinvented itself  (and thus survived) in the wake of digital watches.&quot;</em></p>
<div class="info coluna">
  <p><small> * Importou-nos destacar a sua área de  estudo: o <em>comportamento</em> organizacional. Não é uma escolha inocente.</small></p>
</div>
  <p> Do registo  do tempo ao registo do pensamento, novamente o digital. Deste e do papel, e  agora socorremos-mos do seu <em>abstract</em>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Overall,  this work aims to contribute to extant theory at <b>the intersection of research on technological change, social movements,  and collective identity</b>. Together, these contributions provoke new avenues  to think about how incumbents <b>preserve  legacy technologies and business models</b> in established fields <b>when faced with technological change</b>. </p>
    <p> Because  independent bookstores are, by definition, independent, this setting offers a  unique context to explore this paper&rsquo;s research question<b>: &quot;How do independent actors in a mature industry collectively respond  to a technological discontinuity?&quot;</b><br>

  <p> Especificamente, a orientação do seu estudo:</p>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote>Scholars have pointed to the important role that <b>cognitive framing</b> and <b>collective  identity</b> can play in shaping incumbent responses to technology change <span class="voice">[mas]</span> far less is known about <span class="voice">[estes]</span> mechanisms and processes that explicate how and  why incumbents attempt to preserve mature business models and legacy  technologies within a new technological order.<br>

  </div>
  <p><b>Identidades</b>, portanto. Seguem-se as <b>narrativas</b> oficiais -
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> In the wake  o f a technological discontinuity, <b>the  pervading view is that incumbents will eventually abandon the displaced legacy  technology</b> in favor of the new variant, or fall victim to competitors who  are able to adopt the capabilities associated with the new dominant design.<br>
    <small>in <em><a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/Documents/pdf/2017-11-15 Indie Bookstore Resurgence_Ryan Raffaelli_Extended Abstract_HBSWK.PDF" target="_blank">&quot;Reframing Collective Identity in Response to Multiple Technological   Discontinuities: The Novel Resurgence of Independent Bookstores.&quot;</a></em> <sup>nov 2017</sup></small> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>- e como o estudo as quer contrariar.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <ul class="lista">
      <li>First,  prior research on social movements and organizational responses to  technological change has largely examined how and why incumbent firms  eventually adopt practices or values that <b>emerge  from an outside</b> social movement. Here, I examine an instance where the  locus of the social movement <b>originates  from within</b> the incumbent field as a response to a new technological order. </li>
      <li>Second,  scholars interested in incumbent responses to technological change have  highlighted how <b>collective identity can  become a cognitive trap</b> that can prevent; here again, this paper offers an  alternative view that illustrates how collective identity can become a  mechanism to <b>enable incumbent resilience  and adaptation</b> in the wake of a technological discontinuity. </li>
      <li>Finally,  research at the intersection of social movements and collective identity has  examined how mobilization of normative and economic interests can constitute <b>new market</b> categories with <b>distinct collective identities</b>. This  paper, however, examines how social movements and <b>collective identity</b> mobilization can reshape a <b>mature market</b> category. </li>
    </ul>

  <p>E as conclusões porque já vos estamos a perder:</p>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote>
      <h3> The &quot;3 C&rsquo;s&quot; of independent bookselling&rsquo;s  resurgence:</h3>
      <ul class="lista">
        <li><b>Community:</b> Independent booksellers were some of the first to champion the idea of  localism; bookstore owners across the nation promoted the idea of consumers  supporting their local communities by shopping at neighborhood businesses.</li>
        <li><b>Curation</b>:  Independent booksellers began to focus on curating inventory that allowed them  to provide a more personal and specialized customer experience. Rather than  only recommending bestsellers, they developed personal relationships with  customers by helping them discover up-and-coming authors and unexpected titles.</li>
        <li><b>Convening:</b> Independent booksellers also started to promote their stores as intellectual  centers for convening customers with likeminded interests—offering lectures,  book signings, game nights, children&rsquo;s story times... even birthday parties.</li>
      </ul>

  <p> Mercado, elites, gigantes prepotentes e <em>freaks</em> locais. Mas reparamos: o crédito  reparte-se por uma mistura de estratégias do <em>down-up</em>, as que nos ocuparam até aqui, e <em>top-down</em>:</p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> ABA promoted and codified a collective identity that  established category cohesiveness but simultaneously preserved local store  independence when coupled with bottom-up efforts from store owners</div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>While all this was happening on a local level, there was important top-down work going on at the American Booksellers Association. The <b>ABA</b> served as a glue to bind likeminded players together - facilitating partnerships between bookstores and other local businesses, for example. The ABA also strengthened the collective identity of indie bookstores by helping its members share best practices, such as how to use social media to promote special events.<br>

  <p> Todos felizes portanto: há de tudo um pouco para neoliberais e apologistas do poder  central e local não se chatearam.</p>
  <p>E se falharam em compreender o exemplo dado, recuperamos este vídeo do <b><em> The Lakes International Comic Art Festival</em></b> - um festival de BD na sua 5ª edição.</p>
  <p>Chamamos a vossa atenção à integração deste com as livrarias (e outros estabelecimentos) locais, minuto 1:33 <em>and counting</em>: fica a sugestão aos que organizam festivais.</p>
