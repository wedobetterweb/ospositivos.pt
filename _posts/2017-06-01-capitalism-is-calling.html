  <p>Enquanto  registamos o <em>geist</em> no tópico de<a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/05/capitalism-is-everything.html"> capitalismo e <em>comics</em></a>, é-nos  igualmente relevante uma peça de ontem sobre capitalismo e <em>printing press</em>, da  qual vamos ocultar os gráficos mas que poderão  certamente depreender pelo texto como esses se inclinam. Segue-se o nosso  apanhado do apanhado da peça.</p>
  <blockquote> It&rsquo;s an  annual moment of <strong>print realism</strong> here at Nieman Lab: the posting of the  attention/advertising slide from Mary Meeker&rsquo;s state-of-the-Internet slide  deck. The kind of trends we all know are happening, but whose annual rate of  progress can be hard to judge. Like, say, the continued demise of print.<br>
    <br>
    Since 2011,  the amount of time Americans spend with print has dropped about 40 percent. But  the amount of ad dollars that go to print has dropped even more. So let&rsquo;s  travel back in time.<br>
    <small>in <em><a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/05/the-scariest-chart-in-mary-meekers-slide-deck-for-newspapers-has-gotten-even-a-smidge-scarier/" target="_blank">&quot;The  scariest chart in Mary Meeker&rsquo;s slide deck for newspapers has gotten even a  smidge scarier&quot;</a></em> <sup>31 maio 2017</sup></small></blockquote>
  <div class="info coluna">
  <blockquote>
    <ul class="lista">
      <li>Here&rsquo;s  Meeker&rsquo;s chart for <b>2011</b>: The two things that jump out at me: Print gets a lot  more advertising than it gets attention. And mobile is the opposite. You&rsquo;d  think that would equalize with time.</li>
      <li>Here&rsquo;s <b>2012</b>:  Equalization! Or at least the path to equalization, proportionately. Print  loses attention, but loses ad dollars a bit more quickly; mobile gains  attention, but gains ad dollars a bit more quickly.</li>
      <li>Here&rsquo;s <b>2013</b>:  The print story remains the same: down in attention and in ad dollars. But note  there is still a wide gap between the two — print still gets far more ad  dollars than its hold on the American attention would seem to &ldquo;deserve.&rdquo;</li>
      <li>Here&rsquo;s <b>2014</b>:  The mobile growth everyone anticipated is happening and print continues to lose  both time spent and revenue.</li>
      <li>Here&rsquo;s <b>2015</b>:  On the positive side, print&rsquo;s share of attention remained steady at 4 percent. <span class="voice">[But]</span> steady doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean steady — it just means a pace of decline  less than that. Note, too, that mobile advertising had another huge jump.</li>
      <li>Finally,  here&rsquo;s the newest slide for <b>2016</b>: Take a look at mobile! Up from 12 to 21  percent of ad revenue in one year. We now spend 40 percent more time looking at  media on our phones than on our laptops and desktops. And there&rsquo;s still plenty  of room for growth, both in ad spend and in time spend. But given that the vast  majority of new digital ad revenue goes to Google or Facebook  that money isn&rsquo;t exactly a boon to publishers. But  then there&rsquo;s print — staying steady at 4 percent of time spent for the third  straight year, but another big drop in ad dollars. That lines up with the  evidence that the decline in newspaper print advertising accelerated last year  in a big way.</li>
    </ul>

  <blockquote> Let me wrap  up: <b>print  advertising is not coming back. </b>It will fall further. Substantially further.  All newspaper planning for the coming few years needs to reckon with that basic  fact. 
    Mobile  continues its rocket rise, mobile is eating the world, and most news  organizations make only a pittance off it.<br>

  <p>E poderiamos terminar por aqui mas <em>heres  another quickie</em> em que conseguimos combinar <b>$$$</b> vs <em>free</em>, subsídios do estado, <em>politics</em>, <em>comix</em> (<em>ed cartoons </em>e tudo!),  nazis, imprensa e <em>print</em>... - <em>ya know, tha game, y'all!</em> De <b>&quot;<em>Polska mistrzem Polski</em>&quot;</b>(&quot;<em>Polish Champion of Poland</em>&quot;) por <b>Tomasz Lesniak</b> e <b>Rafal Skarzycki</b>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> The city of Warsaw, Poland has withdrawn a three-year grant supporting an annual comics festival after nationalist groups complained about the content of a comic that was distributed during the event.     The compilation of <em>Polska mistrzem Polski</em> strips by Tomasz Leśniak and Rafał Skarżycki was given away for free at the booth of publisher <b>Timof Comics</b> during the festival in mid-May. The comics festival will no longer receive the rest of the city&rsquo;s grant over the next two years.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Polska mistrzem Polski</em> often mock nationalists as drunken and violent louts.<br>
