  <p>Continuando  no <b>Neil&nbsp;Postman</b>, não saindo da <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> <sup>22 mar 2017</sup>. Sentimo-nos satisfeitos&nbsp;a simplesmente <em>dumpar</em> o texto e  deixar-vos à imaginação as intenções implicadas: arriscamos que não ficarás  longe das linhas mestras que nos guiam. </p>
  <p>Mantém a  reserva ao determinismo tecnológico, soma&nbsp;a <em>web</em> e nesta as redes  sociais, e temos crítico.&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <p><em>Disclaimer</em> necessário já que não escondemos as nossas <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2016/12/work-horse.html">convicções <em>ludditianas</em></a>: poderá parecer que o Neil também o é. E, possivelmente,  talvez o fosse, mas na mesma medida que <b>OS POSITIVOS</b>: o <em>&ldquo;straight&quot;</em> faz toda a  diferença:</p>
    <blockquote> <b>Postman was accused of Luddism, despite his  statement in the conclusion of &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death&quot; that &quot;We must  not delude ourselves with preposterous notions such as the straight Luddite  position.&quot;</b></blockquote>
    <p>Outro:  aquilo da educação. Não somos estranhos à especialidade, e&nbsp;n<b>OS POSITIVOS</b> tentamos fazer  também&nbsp;a nossa parte pelos <em>teens</em>. O Neil tinha igualmente as suas próprias  teorias nessa frente:</p>
    <blockquote> <span class="voice">[No]</span> &quot;The End of Education: Redefining the Value of School&quot; Postman  asserted that education without a myth or narrative to guide and motivate the  student, is education without a purpose.</blockquote>
    <p>Daqui àquele  outro tópico recorrente entre nós é um passo: <b><a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/03/happy-propaganda-day.html">propaganda</a></b>. Mas, do tipo que se recomenda:</p>
    <blockquote> Postman spoke about the function of school being a democracy where  different views are shared to help unite us.</blockquote>
    <p>Com o tal <em>small  print</em> que merecia mais algumas linhas extra da nossa parte no&nbsp;perigo  da <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2016/10/a-inducao-dos-inocentes.html">fragmentação de&nbsp;comunidades</a>.</p>
    <blockquote> In Postman's view, multiculturalism is a separatist movement that destroys  American unity but on the other hand, he discusses teaching through diversity  as an important theme that should be utilized in regard to teaching history,  culture and language.</blockquote>
    <p>Mas dúvidas  haja da missão pedagógica do senhor, além do <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/03/o-processo-criativo-deve-ser-retido.html"><em>&quot;The Disappearance of  Childhood&quot;</em> de ontem</a>, terminamos o <em>disclaimer</em> neste tom:</p>
    <blockquote> In 1969 and 1970 Postman collaborated with New Rochelle educator Alan  Shapiro on the development of a model school based on the principles expressed  in &ldquo;Teaching as a Subversive Activity&quot;.</blockquote>

  <p>Destaques nossos. <em>Duh</em>.</p>
  <h3><em>Amusing  Ourselves to Death</em></h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Postman's best known book, a historical narrative which warns of <b>a decline in the ability of our mass  communications media to share serious ideas</b>. Since television images  replace the written word, Postman argues that <b>television</b> <b>confounds serious  issues by demeaning and undermining political discourse and by turning real,  complex issues into superficial images</b>, less about ideas and thoughts and  more about entertainment. He also argues that television is not an effective  way of providing education, as it provides <b>only  top-down information transfer</b>, <b>rather  than </b>the<b> interaction</b> that he  believes is necessary to maximize learning.</p>
    <p>The book's origins lay in a talk Postman gave participating in a panel on <b>George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four</b> and the contemporary world. Postman said <b>that  the contemporary world was better reflected by Aldous Huxley's Brave New World</b>,  whose public was oppressed by their <b>addiction  to amusement</b>, than by Orwell's work, where they were <b>oppressed by state control</b>.&nbsp;Postman distinguishes the  Orwellian vision of the future, in which totalitarian governments seize  individual rights, from that offered by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World, where <b>people medicate themselves into bliss,  thereby voluntarily sacrificing their rights</b>.</p>
    <p>He draws on the ideas of media theorist <b>Marshall McLuhan</b> to argue that <b>different  media are appropriate for different kinds of knowledge</b>, and describes how  cultures value and transfer oral, literate, and televisual information in  different ways. Postman further examines the differences between written  speech, which he argues reached its prime in the early to mid-nineteenth  century, and the forms of televisual communication, which rely mostly on visual  images to <b>&quot;sell&quot; lifestyles</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Altering  McLuhan's aphorism &quot;the medium is the message&quot;, to <b>&quot;the medium is the metaphor&quot;</b>,  he describes how oral, literate, and televisual cultures radically differ in  the processing and prioritization of information; he argues that each medium is  appropriate for a different kind of knowledge. The faculties requisite for  rational inquiry are simply weakened by televised viewing. Accordingly, <b>reading, exacts intense intellectual  involvement</b>, at once interactive and dialectical; whereas television only  requires passive involvement.&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Destas, algumas  entradas que passam perto das bases:</p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> The tie between information and action has been severed</div>
  <blockquote> Information is now a commodity that can be bought and sold, or used as a  form of entertainment, or worn like a garment to enhance one's status. It comes  indiscriminately, directed at no one in particular, disconnected from  usefulness; we are glutted with information, drowning in information, have no  control over it, don't know what to do with it.</blockquote>
  <p>E uma que  aponta já para o tecnopólio que tratamos a seguir:</p>
  <blockquote> He compares contemporary society to the Middle Ages, where instead of  individuals believing everything told to them by religious leaders, now  individuals believe everything told to them by science, making people more  naive than in Middle Ages. Individuals in a contemporary society, one that is  mediated by technology, could possibly believe in anything and everything,  whereas in the Middle Ages the populace believed (...) there was order to their  beliefs.</blockquote>
  <p>E,  sobretudo, se não ficou claro acima, o&nbsp;TV <em>bashin&rsquo;</em> :)</p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> Television's entertainment value means of which the citizens' rights are  exchanged for consumers&rsquo; entertainment</div>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> Television in its present state, he says, does not satisfy the conditions  for honest intellectual involvement and rational argument.</div>
  <blockquote>The essential premise of the book: <b>&quot;form  excludes the content,&quot;</b> that is, a particular medium can only sustain a  particular level of ideas. Thus rational argument, integral to print  typography, is militated against by the medium of television for this reason.  Television de-emphasises the quality of information in favour of satisfying the  far-reaching needs of entertainment, by which information is encumbered and to  which it is subordinate.</blockquote>
  <p>Daqui também se liga ao conceito de <em>&ldquo;information-action ratio&quot;</em>,  sendo&nbsp;justamente sobre a&nbsp;<em>&quot;inability to act upon much of the  so-called information from televised sources&quot;&nbsp;</em>que deves considerar o  impacto da&nbsp;<em>web</em>. Próximo livro:</p>
  <h3><em>Technopoly</em></h3>
  <p><em>Dead center</em> nas&nbsp;nossas teses - com as  devidas reservas e acrescentos necessários, para vosso deleite:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Postman defines &quot;Technopoly&quot; as a society which believes  &quot;the primary, if not the only, <b>goal  of human labor and thought is efficiency</b>, that technical calculation is in  all respects superior to human judgment ... and that the affairs of citizens  are best guided and conducted by <b>experts</b>.&quot;</p>
    <p><b>A society in  which technology is deified</b>, meaning &ldquo;the culture seeks  its authorization in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and  takes its orders from technology&quot;. It is characterized by a <b>surplus of information generated by  technology</b>, which technological tools are in turn employed to cope with, in  order to <b>provide direction and purpose  for society and individuals</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>Right? right? I know!&nbsp;</em>Continuando:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Postman considers technopoly to be the most recent of three kinds of  cultures distinguished by shifts in their attitude towards technology –  tool-using cultures, technocracies, and technopolies. Each, he says, is produced  by the emergence of new technologies that &quot;compete with old ones…mostly  for dominance of their worldviews&quot;.</p>
    <p>1. Tool-using culture<br>
      Tool-using culture employs technologies only to solve physical problems and  to &quot;serve the symbolic world&quot; of religion, art, politics and  tradition. All such cultures are &quot;unified by some metaphysical  theory&quot;, which forced tools to operate within the bounds of a controlling  ideology and made it &quot;almost impossible for technics to subordinate people  to its own needs&quot;.</p>
    <p>2. Technocracy<br>
      Rather than existing in harmony with a theocratic world-view, tools are  central to the &quot;thought-world&quot; of the culture. Tools &quot;attack  culture…<span class="voice">[and]</span> bid to become culture&quot;, subordinating existing traditions,  politics, and religions. Technocracy<span class="voice"> [is]</span> compelled by the &quot;impulse to  invent&quot;.<span class="voice"> [Porque]</span> human beings could acquire knowledge about the natural  world and use it to &quot;improve the lot of mankind&quot; <span class="voice">[it] </span>led to the idea  of invention for its own sake and the idea of progress.<br>
      However, a technocratic society remains loosely controlled by social and  religious traditions, he clarifies.</p>
    <p>3. Technopoly<br>
      A &quot;totalitarian technocracy&quot;, which demands the &quot;submission  of all forms of cultural life to the sovereignty of technique and  technology&quot;. Technology as autonomous, &quot;self-determinative&quot;  independently of human action, and undirected in its growth. technology in a  time of Technopoly actively eliminates all other &lsquo;thought-worlds&rsquo;. Thus, it  reduces human life to finding meaning in machines and technique.<br>
      This is exemplified, in Postman&rsquo;s view, by <b>the computer</b>, <b>the  &quot;quintessential, incomparable, near-perfect&quot; technology for a  technopoly</b>. It establishes sovereignty over all areas of human experience  based on the claim that it &quot;'thinks' better than we can&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>E por esta  altura estão a pensar&nbsp;<em>&quot;AI!!&quot;</em>, certo?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A technopoly is founded on the belief that technique is superior to lax,  ambiguous and complex human thinking and judgement, <span class="voice">[e]</span> values efficiency,  precision, and objectivity. It also relies upon the &quot;elevation of  information to a metaphysical status: information as both the means and end of  human creativity&quot;. The idea of progress is overcome by the goal of  obtaining information for its own sake. Therefore, <b>a technopoly is characterized by a lack of a cultural coherence or a  &quot;transcendent sense of purpose or meaning&quot;</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>OS POSITIVOS</b>: a criar propósitos.</p>
  <p>Elites e os  outros, e pegamos nesta para a próxima vez:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Consequences of technopoly: new technologies transform those who can create  and use them into an &quot;<b>elite group</b>&quot;,  a knowledge monopoly, which is <b>granted  &quot;undeserved authority and prestige by those who have no such  competence&quot;</b>. Subsequently, Postman claims, those outside of this  monopoly are led to believe in the false &quot;wisdom&quot; offered by the new  technology, which has little relevance to the average person.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Facebooks e  afins, anos antes destes existirem:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>He claims that the U.S has been inundated with technophiles who do not see  the downside of technology. This is dangerous because technophiles want more  technology and thus more information.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A proposta  de solução, e desafio-vos a encontrar diferenças às nossas soluções propostas:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In a 1996 interview, Postman re-emphasized his solution for technopoly,  which was to <b>give students an education  in the history, social effects and psychological biases of technology</b>, so  they may <b>become adults who &quot;use  technology rather than being used by it&quot;</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>Ya welcome.</em><br>
    E a critica feita ao livro, várias frentes. A nossa:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>With the ever-increasing amount of information available &quot;information  has become a form of garbage, not only incapable of answering the most  fundamental human questions but barely useful in providing coherent direction  to the solution of even mundane problems.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>FAILED: big corps</em> fazem sentido da info, de formas que Postman não  poderia prever à data. É uma crítica mais técnica do que conceptual. Seguem-se  as conceptuais, essencialmente batendo no seu&nbsp;<em>technological determinism</em>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Postman's argument stems from the premise that the uses of a technology are  determined by its characteristics, hence, once introduced, each technology  &quot;plays out its hand&quot;, leaving its users to be, in Thoreau&rsquo;s words,  &quot;tools of our tools&quot;.</p>
    <p>a) This pessimistic understanding of pervasive technology renders individuals  &quot;strangely impotent&quot; <span class="voice">[e] </span>underestimate the agency of a technology&rsquo;s  users;<br>
      b) Technologies are shaped by social factors: Postman neglects to account  for the &quot;actual development, adaptation and regulation of technology&quot;;</p>
    <p>Pessimistic accounts of technology overriding culture are based on a  particular vision of human values. They emphasize &quot;artistic <b>creativity</b>, intellectual <b>culture</b>, development of <b>interpersonal relations</b>, or religion as  being the <b>realms in which human freedom  finds expression</b> and in which human fulfilment is to be found&quot;. Technological  optimists merely adhere to an alternative worldview that values the  &quot;exercise of reason in the service of free will&quot; and the ability of  technological developments to &quot;serve human ends&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <p>Novamente,  sobre os&nbsp;sobre pessimistas e otimistas, e com o <em>twist</em> que nos ocupa, recordamos que os&nbsp;nazis são <em>early adopters</em> de tecnologia. Da semana passada:</p>
    <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> Anti-Semites are early adopters</div>
    <blockquote> Throughout history, just about every media platform still in its infancy has acted as a vector for just about every upwelling of anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. Anti-Semites have also exploited the public’s faith in these platforms to spread propaganda. New tech isn’t isn’t the exclusive province of anti-Semites. But in the early days, hateful stuff stands a good shot at rising to the top, or at least finding itself on par with everything else. <br>

  </div>
  <p>O que  merece reforçar da crítica ao tecnopólio a imunidade de ideias que a tecnologia  per se, ainda que as possa vigiar e condicionar,&nbsp;não pode impedir:</p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> New technologies have had remarkably little effect on pre-existing  human beliefs</div>
  <blockquote> The&nbsp;persistence of old world ideologies: technopoly brought about by  communications technologies must result in a drastic change in the beliefs of a  society <span class="voice">[yet]</span> new tools may create new environments, but <strong>do &quot;not  necessarily extinguish older beliefs or the ability to act pragmatically upon  them&quot;</strong></blockquote>
