  <blockquote><h3> &quot;The finger trap&quot;:&nbsp;you are placed loosely within the joke, which is so  playful, so light—why protest?

  <p><em>Segway</em> de&nbsp;ontem: <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/03/a-response-back.html"><em>New Yorker</em>, sátira, cartoons que podem insultar</a> e terminámos com um  excerto datado da wiki sobre privacidade na internet que hoje até é querido e  fofo de tempos mais simples. Hoje: mais web e sátira e humor concebido para  insultar, e&nbsp;começamos justamente com um artigo do <em>New Yorker.</em></p>
  <p>Do início do  ano, o <b><em>&quot;How Jokes Won the Election&quot;</em></b> <sup>23 jan 2017</sup> aborda comédia e humor e  Trumpas e <em>trolls</em>. Já antes fizemos aqui uma clara distinção entre <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/03/trolling-along.html"><em>trolls</em> e trolhas</a>,  hoje parece-nos ideal arrematar conclusões - por mais transientes que sejam <em>thiz  day an&rsquo; age.</em> Confrontando essa narrativa -complementando, ie- o  reconhecimento que não se devem confundir&nbsp;<em>trolls</em> no mesmo pacote. <em>Just, humor me, plisse</em>.</p>

  <blockquote> Since November 9th, we&rsquo;ve heard a lot of talk about unreality, and how  what&rsquo;s normal bends when you&rsquo;re in a state of incipient autocracy. (...) But  what killed me last year were the jokes, because I love jokes—dirty jokes, bad  jokes, rude jokes, jokes that cut through bullshit and explode pomposity.  Comedy might be cruel or stupid, yet, in aggregate, it was the rebel&rsquo;s stance. <strong>Nazis were humorless</strong>. Jokes were a superior way to tell the truth—that  meant freedom for everyone.<br>
    <br>
    But by 2016 the wheel had spun hard the other way: now it was the  neo-fascist strongman who held the microphone and an army of anonymous  dirty-joke dispensers who helped put him in office. Online, jokes were powerful  accelerants for lies—a tweet was the size of a one-liner, a &quot;dank meme&quot; carried  farther than any op-ed, and the distinction between a Nazi and someone  pretending to be a Nazi for &quot;lulz&quot; had become a blur.<br>

  <blockquote> Literal Hitler was an inside joke, destabilizing by design; as with any  subcultural code, from camp to hip-hop, it was crafted to confuse outsiders  [one of a thousand such memes, flowing from anonymous Internet boards that were  founded a decade ago, a free universe that was crude and funny and juvenile and  anarchic by design, a teen-age-boy safe space]. Then it morphed, as jokes did  so quickly last year, into a weapon that might be used to mock any comparisons  to Hitler—even when a guy with a serious Hitler vibe ran for President<br>

  <p><em>Enter</em> o <em>troll</em>.</p>
  <blockquote> Two thousand sixteen was the year that those inside jokes were released in  the wild.<br>
    <br>
    There was in fact a global army of trolls who were eagerly &quot;shit-posting&quot; on Trump&rsquo;s behalf. Like Trump&rsquo;s statements, their quasi-comical memeing and  name-calling was so destabilizing, flipping between serious and silly, that <b>it  warped the boundaries of discourse</b>.<br>

  <p>Mas é neste  ponto que devemos olhar para esse discurso com mais atenção. Não discordamos da  apanhado do humor que a peça acima retrata, mas onde se cruza ao trolha merece  a clarificação que registamos em seguida. As <em>jokes</em> -talvez, mais  adequado traduzir por no singular por&nbsp;<em>&quot;a grande piada&quot;</em>-&nbsp;ganharam  as eleições, não os trolls, eles não têm super poderes, apenas <em>shit-posts</em>.

    <p> This all makes for a compelling narrative. But what actually happened isn't  so straightforward. (…)&nbsp;It cannot and should not be tethered to online  communities of the past.</p>
    These assumptions are worth challenging, well beyond issues of semantics,  well beyond research quibbles, well beyond academic flag planting. (...) It is  therefore imperative that we are clear about what is known, what has precedent,  and what in the hell we are even talking about when we talk about  &quot;trolling&quot; in 2017.<br>

  <div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> In 2017, the term &quot;trolling&quot; doesn't mean much. And yet it is  thrown around as easy shorthand</div>
  <blockquote> The first and most basic point to contest is the idea that  &quot;trolling&quot; is an appropriate descriptor for the white nationalist  alt-right. Though the word &quot;trolling&quot; rose to prominence in the  early-mid 2000s as a specific, bounded point of subcultural self-identification,  the term has been applied to so many different kinds of behaviors in so many  different contexts over the last ten years that big and small, damaging and  harmless, progressive and reactionary, are now flattened into one slippery  category vaguely suggesting disruptiveness.<br>
    <br>
    That use of the term &quot;troll&quot; when referring to contemporary 4chan  users posits a false equivalency between those who were described as trolls in  the past and those who are described as trolls in the present. As if trolling  (or what's referred to as trolling) now is the same thing as what was referred  to as trolling then. The fact is, even back then—in the ancient civilization of  2007—trolls were a heterogeneous bunch. Self-identifying trolls could be  harmless pranksters, less harmless troublemakers, and merciless abusers. Some  expressed vicious bigotries; some expressed more ambivalent bigotries; and some  didn't express any bigotries. <b>Some even trolled bigots</b>.<br>
    <br>
    Calling antagonists—particularly white nationalist antagonists—&quot;trolls&quot;  in 2017, and furthermore linking these &quot;trolls&quot; to the trolls of  yesteryear, overwrites the fracture that always existed within <b>early trolling  subculture</b>. This doesn't just tie contemporary &quot;trolls&quot; to a homogenous  legacy that never existed, it implicitly suggests that we've been here before;  that online trolling is same as it ever was. But we haven't, and it isn't.  Trolling never was any one thing, and it certainly wasn't the thing the  alt-right has metastasized into.<br>
    <br>
    The idea that 4chan and its presumably interchangeable spawn Anonymous is  fundamentally &quot;united by a common culture and set of values, fuzzy around  the edges, but solid at the core,&quot; just <b>doesn't hold up in the face of  the verifiable historical record</b>.<br>

  <h3 class="centre"><em>&quot;Communities Change</em>&quot;</h3>
  <blockquote> The second claim warranting pushback is the false assumption that alt-right  &quot;trolling&quot; is equally interchangeable with 4chan and Anonymous, an  assumption that posits static, ahistorical framings of both. Making this claim,  either explicitly or implicitly, obscures the one basic, unifying fact of 4chan  and Anonymous: that they change, both in terms of demographics and  ideologically .<br>

  <h3 class="centre"><em>&quot;The Dangers of Amplifying False Narratives&quot;</em></h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The third issue to address is the seemingly explanatory idea that alt-right  trolls—were the lynchpin for securing Trump's Presidential victory. That  activity didn't happen in a vacuum, and wasn't self-propelling.  &quot;Trolls&quot; and the alt-right may have played a prominent role in the  2016 election, but that fact is dependent upon and cannot be untangled from  journalistic coverage that amplified their messaging.</p>
    <p>Media coverage—even coverage condemning alt-right antagonisms—helped  conjure this monster, and how that conjuring, in turn, helped amplify Trump's overall  platform (which itself was a series of memes). The fact that alt-right  participants received so much coverage speaks to an even deeper issue, perhaps  the weightiest issue, influencing Donald Trump's rise. More than fake news,  more than filter bubbles, more than insane conspiracy theories about child sex  rings operating out of the backs of Washington DC pizza shops, <b>the biggest  media story to emerge from the 2016 election was the degree to which far-right  media were able to set the narrative agenda for mainstream media outlets</b>.</p>
    <p>What Breitbart did was ensure that what far-right pundits were talking  about became what everyone was talking about, what everyone had to talk about,  if they wanted to keep abreast of the day's news cycle. Alt-right antagonisms—their  &quot;trolling&quot;—was one cloud among many in this gathering storm, one  roaring towards the mainstream from the far-far right. <b>Shitpost participants  adeptly harnessed this energy, they didn't create this energy.</b><br>

  <p> E, aquilo de  tentar sequestrar a narrativa? Devolvemos ao primeiro artigo, na comparação de Trump e <em>stand-up  comedy</em>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Trump was a hot comic (...) He was the insult  comic, the stadium act, the ratings-obsessed headliner who shouted down  hecklers. His rallies boiled with rage and laughter, which were hard to tell  apart. Like that of any stadium comic, Trump&rsquo;s brand was control. <br>
      <br>
      The Big Lie is a propaganda technique: state  false facts so outlandish that they must be true, because who would make up  something so crazy? <b>Lying about telling  the truth is part of the joke.</b><b> </b><br>
