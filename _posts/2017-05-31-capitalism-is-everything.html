  <p>Não levamos  a mal que os 'tugas não publiquem bd politizada - mesmo lá fora poucos o fazem.  Por alguma razão chegámos ao <em>cartoon</em> editorial.</p>
<div class="info coluna">  <blockquote>       I was asked recently if there are any comics that could be useful in  guiding us in this general election. Beyond keeping up with the political  cartoonists in newspapers and magazines, I&rsquo;m afraid to say that there isn&rsquo;t  really, or none that my research could delve up.  </blockquote></div>
  <p>Nem nos  queixamos que estes não sejam um veículo construtivo mas desconstrutivo -<a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/05/castelo-de-vampiros.html">aquilo de ontem</a><sup>(*)</sup>-, ou que sejam opinados -ie, tendenciosos, ou uma catarse  do seu público -ie, a bolha - </p>

  <p>- mas senhores, temos o eterno problema com <em>o bottom line</em> que parece estar sempre  por lá a pairar: <b>$$$.</b>    </p>
   <blockquote> The problem with relying on political cartoonists is that they look for  absurdities in current events - of which there are perhaps too many - rather  than highlighting what works in any given manifesto. They will also be biased,  towards their own views and the social bent of the publication that pays them.<br>

  <p>E no tópico  de quem paga a conta cruzado à luta de classes, <em>comics style,</em> um ponto de  situação para memória futura de que voltaremos a fazer sentido quando voltarmos  a MF - previsto algures para as férias de verão, e nem esse pequeno pormenor é inocente  :)</p>
  <p><i>Case-study:</i>  a despedida anunciada de <b>Hannah Berry</b> no lançamento do seu mais recente livro<em><b> &quot;Livestock&quot;</b></em>,<em><a href="http://hannahberry.co.uk/livestock-preview/" target="_blank"> &quot;a socio-political satire on the relationship  between politics, the media, and us.&quot;</a></em> Hey, acrescentem<em> &quot;and  technology&quot; </em>na descrição e são as nossas teses.</p>
  <p>Da conclusão  à introdução, no contexto das eleições por vir no UK:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Whatever funding opportunities we might be able to build for the growth of  UK comics, it will eventually <b>lead back to the government spring</b>. According  to their respective manifestos, both of the major parties have plans that will  affect the UK comics industry through its businesses and individual creators,  so it's worth reading up on their plans for <b>arts funding</b>.<br>

  <p>A mama do  Estado - sem julgamentos e voltaremos aqui no final. Antes, palavra a HB, destaques nossos.</p>
  <h3 class="centre"> <em>&quot;Comics are everything&quot; </em></h3>
 <div class="info coluna"> <blockquote>       I am 34, and one day I will be dead. When that day arrives, will I look  back over my creations and whisper &ldquo;it was all worth it&rdquo; into the empty room?  The room that is empty because I&rsquo;ve ignored everyone who ever loved me so that  I could get those sweet ISBNs?  </blockquote></div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>    Ah, the noble dedication of the lonely artist, working long into the night!  Sworn to a puritanical existence; eschewing simple pleasures so that they can  commit fully to their craft. Their métier. Their fucking oeuvre. I&rsquo;m not sure  who ever found this poetic view of their daily life to be accurate, but allow  me to knock it from the rafters like the sinister wasps' nest that it is.</p>
    <p class="centre"># </p>
<p>To make a graphic novel takes me three years of blinkered, fanatical  dedication, and I realised while working on Livestock that I just can&rsquo;t do it  again. I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;m out. And from quiet talks with many other graphic  novelists, ones whose books you know and love, I can tell you that I&rsquo;m far from  being the only one. This is the problem with making graphic novels in the UK  today, and it&rsquo;s one we need to address:<b> the  numbers do not add up</b>.</p>
    <p>By comicking terms, I am super privileged: I&rsquo;m published by Cape, I got an  Arts Council grant, after 12 years I&rsquo;m at a point in my career where I can get  paid gigs for speaking, cartooning, illustrating, editing and whatnot, and I  have a partner who is both willing and able to support me. I have all of this  behind me, and I. Still. Struggled.</p>
     <p class="centre"># </p>
    <p>Human beings need money in order to pay for food and shelter, in order to  not become dead. This is a truism that is somehow still forgotten in today&rsquo;s  skill-devaluing, pitch-for-work, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s good for exposure&rsquo; climate. Now, I&rsquo;m a  simple girl with simple needs, and part of my puritanical mania manifests  itself in living as cheaply as possible. The only way I&rsquo;ve been able to survive  as a graphic novelist is by being supported by my wonderful, long-suffering,  devilishly handsome partner. As a fine, upstanding feminist, this does not make  me feel good about myself. It&rsquo;s actually pretty embarrassing to admit, in fact,  but here we are.</p>

    <p>Graphic novels - long-form comic books if you prefer - take a long time to  make. Since 2010 I&rsquo;ve been one of the relatively few people I know to be  working on comics more or less full-time. I take on other jobs - miscellaneous  freelance work, events, workshops etc - but my main source of income is the  graphic novels, so finishing these things as quickly as possible is an absolute  necessity. To do that, I&rsquo;m always working. That&rsquo;s not cheery hyperbole - the  idea of stopping because it&rsquo;s the evening or the weekend is absurd. Bank  holidays are just that: holidays for the bank. I work on my birthday. On  Christmas day I&rsquo;ll sneak away from my family to get a couple of hours in. If  I&rsquo;m prised from my desk to go on holiday I&rsquo;ll bring a script and a pad and get  some planning done.
      When the sun is shining and everyone else in Brighton is on the beach, I&rsquo;ll  be at my desk with the window open. It&rsquo;s a punishing way to live, but <b>I don&rsquo;t see any alternative</b>.</p>
    <p>But this oppressive self-discipline is born from necessity, because this is  my full-time job and I need to make it work. I need to make comics work.</p>
     <p class="centre"># </p>
    I can&rsquo;t blame the publishers: the readership is so small that they can&rsquo;t  take advantage of economies of scale, so there&rsquo;s very little profit to be made  and passed on. I can&rsquo;t blame the readers, who already part with surprisingly  large amounts of money in exchange for our marvellous works. I can&rsquo;t blame the  comics community itself, which is as supportive and welcoming a group of people  as ever existed.<br>
    But I do have one idea. Increasingly I&rsquo;ve been turning my eyes towards the  wider support for the arts across the country. These are tough times for arts  and culture all across the board, but if ballet can get hundreds of millions of  pounds worth of funding, why shouldn&rsquo;t comics? Maybe the way we move forward,  as a group, is to take what we do as an art form seriously? Maybe it&rsquo;s time we  demanded some funding and recognition for this fucking oeuvre?<br>

  <p>E o destaque  que queremos fazer. <em>Class war! Us vs Them! </em>Ou, o <em>ballet:</em></p>
  <blockquote>  Our audience is far broader, and our need is far greater, and as artists we  work just as hard as those gnarl-footed prancers. (Sorry, ballet dancers, that  was uncalled for. I didn&rsquo;t mean it.)<br>

  <p>No original  não o irás reparar da mesma forma, foi a nossa sensibilidade ao tema -aquilo do  &quot;tendencioso&quot;- que zerou rapidamente nesta. Ao longo do texto  encontramos muitas outras pistas: <em>&quot;who is to blame?&quot;</em> <em>&quot;não há  alternativas&quot;</em>, ou <em>&quot;porque nos habituámos que é assim&quot;</em>...? A  autora não será certamente alheia a essas preocupações -vide quer o tema do seu  livro! ou comentários como o<em> &quot;skill-devaluing, pitch-for-work, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s good  for exposure&rsquo;&quot;</em>- mas não em momento algum se interroga sobre o modelo em  que se baseia e implicitamente reconhece que é um jogo de soma zero, com o remendo tradicional. Voltamos ao início: recorre-se ao governo para que este ligue as  torneiras do Estado. Nesse tópico, um pequeno <em>recuerdo</em> do  que se passa nessa frente: onde<em> &quot;crafts&quot;</em>, $$$ e Estados se cruzam, e  o <em>overlap</em> que fazem às preocupações da Hannah, de todos os seus dias investidos  no seu trabalho.  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>    Robots are taking over the world&rsquo;s workforce—and why shouldn&rsquo;t they? For so  many jobs, machines are faster, more consistent, smarter, and cheaper than you  or I will ever be. Along with their jobs, people will lose their incomes. When  that happens, governments will also lose theirs.<br>
      Where does the money come from without incomes to tax? Tax the robots. A  robot tax isn&rsquo;t going to save jobs, but the idea is that it could help cushion  the impact of mass automation by funding a <strong>universal basic  income</strong>.<br>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Robots e  <em>universal income to tha rescue? Capitalist Realism </em> nas férias, <em>we say :)</em> Últimas palavras à HB:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>    How many people are out there who could be, should be, making graphic  novels but can&rsquo;t afford financially to commit to this lifestyle? Or can&rsquo;t afford  the time to focus on a novel-length comic? Or any comic, for that matter? How  many stories are left unwritten because circumstances force them to be forever  kept on the back burner?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Quantos? <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2016/12/work-horse.html">Aquilo do  <b>$$$</b></a>: não te vendas.</p>
