<p><a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/07/mudar-para-nao-ficar-igual.html"><em>Blogs</em>, dizíamos?</a> Um <em>long read</em> muito a propósito acabado de publicar,  que mesmo o nosso <em>mashup</em> não consegue encurtar o suficiente para te  convidar à leitura, mas és tu que ficas a perder. Tantos tópicos no  digital: da <em>web</em>, mudanças de formatos e media, <b>$$$,</b> <em>ads</em>, <em>bots</em> &amp; <em>jobs</em>, <em>fake  news</em> e, claro, a <strong>autenticidade</strong> ao fundo. Uma comunidade - de leitores e  produtores - atravessa o texto, um que se preocupa com a produção de texto,&nbsp;cruzando&nbsp;educação,  informação e entretenimento. <b>Facebook</b> e outros <em>rants</em>. Trolhas, <em>memes</em>,  activismo online. <em>Old media</em> e <em>television</em>. <b>Neil  Postman</b>. Pela terceira vez nos repetimos: <em>tha  works</em>. E começando pelo fim, <em>&quot;<b>why is this important?&quot;</b></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Because my experience  is a microcosm of what happened to media in the 21st century and it can begin  to explain how we ended up in an era of intentional ignorance and with a truly  broken media.&nbsp;</b></p>
  <p>I love the news. I love media. And I  especially love online media. That we have allowed this medium – so strong, so  swift, so fleet – to be demeaned in this way is a terrible shame and may prove  to be a great tragedy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Num só parágrafo da sua conclusão, onde  simultaneamente concordamos e discordamos. Tentem separar: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I think the media must escape this current  death spiral and the only way to truly pull up is to abandon the numerical  value judgements associated with traffic and page views. The real answer, ultimately, will be micropayments and  subscriptions – but that requires the destruction of the robots that hunt out  and provide free content. To destroy those robots we must convince ourselves  that real news matters and costs money. That, friends, is the hardest job ever. </p>

<div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> The  intellectual would say I was experimenting with the form but, in reality, I was  just messing around. </div>
<blockquote>
  <p>I was  full-time blogger, the little brother to the journalist, the  digital-ink-stained wretch that pounded out content for millions of readers  with speed and attempted accuracy.&nbsp;Back then, when blogging was new, I  would click a button on my computer to bring up a list of exciting and interesting  pieces of information. I would select sixteen to twenty stories,  opening them one by one and placing them, like cans to be plinked on a rail, on  my tabs bar.&nbsp;I was part of the new journalistic vanguard. We were told to thumb our noses at the establishment, to push PR  flacks in front of trains, to ignore the spin and get to the truth. We wrote  quickly and often. In the beginning, I wrote up to 28 posts per day  – 200 to 500 word &quot;journalistic&quot; pieces – based on these links. They were  extremely standard chunks of informative media, so divorced from context or  interconnection that they could have acted as curatorial notes for an artist  that everyone already knows. What I wrote contained none of the hallmarks of  traditionally good writing. It did not contain contextual prerequisites, a  sense of wonder or perplexity, and I left exposition to HTML tags.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>  My  writing changed as the Internet changed. My style morphed, in year one, from  eager and breathless to cynical and sardonic as the avalanche of post requirements  took over my life.&nbsp;The stress made me judgmental and hostile. <b>I was  running at a hundred miles an hour so why wasn&rsquo;t everyone else?</b>&nbsp;The  important thing to note is that I was probably consuming as much news and  content in 2001 as the average Facebook and Twitter user does today. And it  made me crazy. It hurt me.&nbsp; <br>
    Slowly,  however, the medium evolved. There was a definite push back toward<b> long form  journalism</b> and startups appeared who attempted to monetize what magazines  had been doing for a century. Everyone started blogging, from neo-Nazis to  Pioneer Women to Bill Gates.&nbsp;But still traffic was paramount. When  everyone was a blogger the slices of the traffic pie we could access would  shrink. We had to figure out a way to grab more  traffic in a crowded news marketplace.&nbsp;We upped the post count and we  upped our traffic. &nbsp;We wanted to get stuff up as quickly as  possible.  </p>
</blockquote>
<div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> And I was cheap. </div>
<blockquote>
  <p>  I wrote  quickly and poorly. I raged against all I learned in journalism school&nbsp; <br>
    There were also opinion pieces thrown in here and  there on slow days but the readers usually ignored them. Alternatively, we  would write unpopular pieces of opinion detailing our preference for one phone  over another and unleash a firestorm of reactions with comment counts numbering  in the hundreds. We were like maintenance men of a massive ant farm regularly  dropping sugar pellets into the mix to keep the ants happy and then introducing  a wasp or two to keep things interesting. At the same time the demand for this sort  of content was growing. People wanted to read about the latest stuff from a  team of folks who knew a lot about it. We were providing a constant source of information unmatched in  the media industry. Everything, from <b>newspapers</b> to <b>television</b>, to <b>magazines</b>, required <b>processing time</b>. A live shoot from a traffic  emergency required a dozen or so engineers at the station to manage the feed  and send it to your television screen where million-dollar anchors bantered  about the weather. Newspapers had meetings where they decided the next day&rsquo;s  news and the magazine industry had long lunches where they planned next Spring  in the Summer.&nbsp;<b>We didn&rsquo;t do that.</b> We just wrote.&nbsp;I pushed it  out as fast as I could, not caring who read it or why. By the time the old newspapermen and women trundled to their  offices to write up the event we bloggers already had four stories written and  were on to the next thing. <b>They could not compete.</b>&nbsp;We beat everyone  to the punch. Everyone. No major media organization built before the year 2001  could match our speed and traffic.   </p>
</blockquote>
<div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> TC  writer Devin Coldewey wrote that in blogging you could have three things –  speed, accuracy, or insight – but you could only pick two for every post. We  aimed for speed and accuracy more than insight.   </div>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Early  on, people associated our writing with gonzo journalism. I didn&rsquo;t. Hunter S.  Thompson was writing in a post-television style, a whirlwind of images and  disconnected conversation that was held together by the spectacle of his  language and the fireworks of his prose. Thompson brought the rushed confidence  and bacchanal of a movie star to the page. I fulfilled the desires of an  inelegant but constantly media-hungry, Internet-based workforce by writing like  one of their chat room buddies.</b> </p>
  <p>  Then,  slowly, our techniques spread.&nbsp;The impetus to blog moved from  the quick and dirty blogging world of my wayward youth into newsrooms around  the country. Huge sites sprung up dedicated to our special sort of content.  Buzzfeed, the home of the listicle, packaged so much media in such a readable  package that it changed the way we read regular news sites. Suddenly an entire news industry sprung up and current news sites  changed drastically. They picked up on all of the bad habits I learned by being  speedy. The triple-sourced, copy-edited, fact-checked news story turned into  the hot take. Research fell to Google searches. Forethought fell to the impetus  for traffic. Complexity fell to the needs of the lowest common denominator.  When everything is breaking news there is no breaking news. Everything receives  equal import and equal attention which is to say none at all.&nbsp;And it went  on and on, post after post. The old Internet, the idea of  one person connecting with a few people in a meaningful way, fell away and a <b>new paradigm emerged, that of the meme, the idea that hops from site to site  like a virus hops hosts. And that viral information  offered something very special to the average reader: It offered instant  comfort and it scratched the itch of the new. It became some of the most  compelling entertainment around</b>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Why is this important?</b> <b>Because  my experience is a microcosm of what happened to media in the 21st century and  it can begin to explain how we ended up in an era of intentional ignorance and  with a truly broken media.&nbsp;</b>The tools we perfected  in those early days were some of the most pernicious and powerful tools in  existence, honed to razor sharpness to cut off only the fattest parts of the  truth, abandoning the nuance.&nbsp;We were not originally  butchers – we had loftier goals – but when traffic (and traffic bonuses) became  our driving impetus and when Google advertisers valued eyeballs over brains we  had to provide content that fit a certain mindset and provide it at speed.</p>
  <p>  At the  same time another interesting group of Internet users began taking advantage of  a world defined by fast, loose, and easy. These users, primarily found on sites  like Reddit and 4chan, were digital natives and had a deep understanding of how  to make something bubble to the surface of the Internet. These tricksters  organized under the name&nbsp;<b>Anonymous</b>. Their &quot;ops&quot; were often ineffective but they help train an entire  generation in what can be called online activism. This training involved  &quot;making&quot; news by surfacing exactly the content the Anons wanted to showcase.  In short the once-insular and insulated world of the Internet was  actively spreading its tentacles into the real world.</p>
  <p> In his  seminal book&nbsp;<b><a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/03/amusing-ourselves-to-death.html"><em>Amusing  Ourselves To Death</em></a>,</b>&nbsp;<b>Neil  Postman</b> chronicled the move from the Typographical Age – an  age of deep concentration that required prodigious levels of patience and  education in nearly every citizen – to the Show Biz Age. This transition, to  Postman, meant that mankind was leaving behind evidence, forethought, and  eloquence and instead took up a language made up of constantly moving pictures. To him the villain creeping into the modern mind was the boob tube  and he went so far as to notice the correlation between the then nascent USA  Today and the short-burst imagery of television.&nbsp;He wrote his book in  1985. He was  writing at the tail end of a societal change that began with the invention of  the moving picture and ended with Al Gore saying he invented the Internet in a  televised debate.&nbsp;Over the past two decades we have replaced Postman&rsquo;s  commercials with native advertising – ads disguised craftily as news stories.&nbsp;We have built an industry that supplies us with no eloquence but  an endless words. We read news story after news story in multiple formats –  silent videos, social shares, headlines on Twitter – and we build a worldview  with them.&nbsp;<b>Sadly, many of these news stories are not initially aimed at  human consumption.</b>&nbsp;Instead they are created for  robots to read in order to grab the attention of huge search engines. <b>In fact, much of the  content that appears on the Web is made by robots for robots, a fact that  should give anyone searching for artificial intelligence pause.</b>&nbsp;The  Internet is also controlling what we perceive.&nbsp;Robots watch where we go, track our clicks, and serve up  advertisements and, sometimes, news directly related to what we just clicked.  Robots bid for advertising space on the pages we visit, know that we in particular  are interested in, say, electric bikes, lingerie, and fishing gear. The robot  that is essentially following us knows these things about us and sends  applicable advertisements. Thus website owners can tell themselves that they  aren&rsquo;t beholden to advertisers and are able to write things that might vaguely  attract an electric-biking lingerie-clad fisherwoman. The problem is when the  website owners game this system, creating content that you might absolutely  love or fake news that will appeal to a very specific, very vociferous  collection of conspiracy theorists and cranks.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  name we can properly give to education without prerequisites, perplexity, and  exposition is entertainment,&quot; Postman wrote. However, at the turn of the  century the great hope was that <b>information could replace education thereby  bypassing entertainment</b>.&nbsp;With all learning at our  fingertips we would be augmented.&nbsp;We didn&rsquo;t need no education in  the formal sense – an education purely based on the recreation of a set of  rules and symbols inside of a group of like-minded children. We were thrown  into a world where that rote learning was unnecessary.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s where we are.&nbsp;The Internet was supposed to grow our  brains. We were supposed to be better, faster, and more efficient. Instead we were given a firehose that only occasionally spews  water.&nbsp;In our current culture the Internet is allowed  to drone on and on.&nbsp;Under the onslaught we are truly powerless. We cannot  control what we see and the only way to turn off the feed is to delete our  Facebook apps.&nbsp;And this, sadly, is the worst thing we can do. The  neophilic impulse is strong and things like Facebook and Twitter directly  stimulate the pleasure centers of our brains. We refresh our email not because  we assume something important will appear but because we get a thrill when  someone contacts us. We are so lonely that we turn  the Internet into a friend and ignore the real world. And, finally, the  Internet joins us in the real world, bringing firehose fever dreams to life in  popular culture.</p>
  <p>  But instead  of this promised blossoming of the modern mind, instead of education in an  instant, we snapped our fingers and got entertainment, a medium without  prerequisites, perplexity, and exposition.&nbsp;We have come full circle. Like  dandies in 1910 we watch soundless videos on Facebook captioned with clever and  breathless prose and accompanied by wild music. We receive only the snippets of  important programs that are recommended us by friends and we watch important  events unfold and debates happen with the expectation that something – anything  – will come up next. We have an endless supply of ridiculous videos, news  snippets, and political opinions all served up on demand in an instant. We see  – not read – more in one day than the average 1800s farmer saw in his lifetime. </p>

  <p>When we  made a deal with the angels of the Information Age we also got the devils. The  devils are fake news, fake outrage, and anti-intellectualism. As trusted news  sources fell to the Internet untrusted sources took their place. As discussion  blossomed through the Internet – a discussion unavailable when sitting in front  of your TV – along came outrage. And when everything is true the suspicious  mind believes nothing is.&nbsp;<b>Because of all the content available to the  average computer user there is no sorting mechanism that makes sense.&nbsp;</b>The  vision of news curated by a careful and intelligent hand – a media landscape  that blogs once attempted to create – is essentially gone replaced by a sense  that the news media is rigged. Further, because everything looks just about the  same on the Internet the signals of propriety and truth – nice layouts, paper  stock, headlines and bylines – <b>has gone out the window.&nbsp;</b></p>
