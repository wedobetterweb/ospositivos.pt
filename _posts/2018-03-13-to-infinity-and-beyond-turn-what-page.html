  <blockquote>
    <p>The medium is still suffering from an identity crisis, as it has become  clear with scholars continuing struggle to find an appropriate definition of  what comics actually is. It has tried to lean on the visual arts, as well as  literature, for support, to allow it to gain legitimacy&nbsp;as a form.  However, this has caused even more confusion and disagreements among scholars  regarding the origin, nature, and purpose of comics. Appropriating blindly any  hybrid form containing comics elements as belonging to the medium of comics,  then, would only complicate the matter further.<br>

    <p>It&quot;s notoriously difficult to define comics and in the case of digital comics this might prove even more challenging  due to the malleable and ever-changing nature of digital media, in constantly  &quot;in danger&quot; of becoming something other than a comic.

Being a combination of visual and textual components, comics offer many  ways in which these can be reshaped and presented in a new light.<b> The physical limitations of the printed  page</b> are lifted as computer screens offer <b>virtually unlimited space</b> to  arrange comics panels.</p>
    <p>The  conceptualisation of comics as tied to the comic book is understandable, since  the medium was born and popularised in print, and some of its main  characteristics, such as the speech balloon, the motion lines, and the graphic  sound effects, emerged precisely because of the limitations of print.

    <p><b>The idea of the panel</b>, and the sequential arrangement of panels on the page are still very intimately connected with the medium of comics.

      <li>It is a video, awkwardly animated out of drawings that once used to be a comic.

  <p><sup>2) </sup>In contrast to traditional&nbsp;comic books,  where one can quickly flip through the pages and get an overview by glancing at  the pages and page number [...] unless one reads the story from beginning to end in one take,  there&nbsp;is a great risk of losing oneself in this immense horizontal strip.
