<p>Hoje: apenas um rodapé <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2016/12/pobres-ricos-pobres-ricos.html">ao tema aberto ontem</a>. Falávamos de algoritmos, entramos na AI, enredámos à <em>framework</em> total, aqui temos que acrescentar uma nota à mais evidente força de transformação da sociedade: o trabalho. Não se pode compreender a humanidade sem compreender como esta se estratifica e relaciona dependendo das actividades que cada qual desenvolve, garante, ou é obrigado a prestar. </p>
<p>Do artigo <em>&ldquo;Will smarter machines cause mass unemployment?&rdquo;</em> -</p>
<blockquote> So which jobs are most vulnerable?
  <p>What determines vulnerability to automation, experts say, is not so much whether the work concerned is manual or white-collar but whether or not it is routine<span class="voice"> [and has] </span>most jobs can be broken down into a series of routine tasks, more and more of which can be done by machines.</p>
The workforce bifurcates into two groups doing non-routine work: highly paid, skilled workers (such as architects and senior managers) on the one hand and low-paid, unskilled workers (such as cleaners and burger-flippers) on the other.<br>

<p>E este destaque é um extra totalmente gratuito mas aqui fica porque somos assim :)</p>
<blockquote> Some forms of journalism, such as writing market reports and sports summaries, are also being automated.<br>

<p>Continuando, da mais variada literatura, retirados de livros com títulos tão sugestivos como<em> &ldquo;Humans Need Not Apply&rdquo;</em> ou <em>&ldquo;Rise of the Robots&rdquo;</em>, a peça resume os dois sentimentos que recolhemos na nossa última entrada: o &ldquo;já aqui estivemos antes&rdquo; e o &ldquo;mas agora é diferente&rdquo;. Começando pelos luddites:</p>
<blockquote> The &ldquo;lump of labour&rdquo; fallacy: a notion that there&rsquo;s only a finite amount of work to do, and therefore that if you automate some of it there&rsquo;s less for people to do, is just totally wrong,&rdquo;
  <p>Predictions that automation will make humans redundant have been made before, however, going back to the Industrial Revolution, when textile workers, most famously the Luddites, protested that machines and steam engines would destroy their livelihoods. (...) Yet in the past technology has always ended up creating more jobs than it destroys. (...) Automating a particular task, so that it can be done more quickly or cheaply, increases the demand for human workers to do the other tasks around it that have not been automated. (...) In other words, technology gradually changed the nature of the weaver&rsquo;s job, and the skills required to do it, rather than replacing it altogether.</p>
  <p>The same pattern can be seen in industry after industry after the introduction of computers,(...) rather than destroying jobs, automation redefines them, and in ways that reduce costs and boost demand. The net effect was that more computer-intensive jobs within an industry displaced less computer-intensive ones. Computers thus reallocate rather than displace jobs, requiring workers to learn new skills. This is true of a wide range of occupations, Mr Bessen found, not just in computer-related fields such as software development but also in administrative work, health care and many other areas.</p>
And no matter how advanced artificial intelligence becomes, some jobs are always likely to be better done by humans, notably those involving empathy or social interaction. (...) A central economic mechanism by which automation affects the demand for labour (...) raises the value of the tasks that can be done only by humans.<br>

<p>Sobre esta última, assim se explica porque se resume a duas opções: <em>flip-a-burger</em> ou CEO de uma startup.</p>
<div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> 
  Imagine trying to tell someone a century ago that her great-grandchildren would be video-game designers or cybersecurity specialists, he suggests. &ldquo;These are jobs that nobody in the past would have predicted.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> 
  As those industries decline, new ones will emerge.</div>
<p>Por outro lado, como não é bem assim:</p>
<blockquote> But couldn&rsquo;t this time be different? (...) The impact of automation this time around is broader-based: not every industry was affected two centuries ago, but every industry uses computers today. (...) Another difference is that whereas the shift from agriculture to industry typically took decades, software can be deployed much more rapidly.<br>

<p>A ponto de, do mesmo artigo, a necessidade de uma prescrição – e quando esta é necessária, sabes que é sério:</p>
<blockquote> But despite the wide range of views expressed, pretty much everyone agrees on the prescription: that companies and governments will need to make it easier for workers to acquire new skills and switch jobs as needed.<br>

<p>E, perdoem-nos se estamos a ler entrelinhas, mas soa-nos à oficialização da condição precária. Tanto que, para o despistar – confirmar – vos deixamos o <em>mashup</em> da leitura principal de hoje: <em>where to now, when it comes. </em>Ontem debruçamo-nos abundantemente no pós-capitalismo, conceito que por algumas vezes se relacionava a um retorno a eras passadas – não como retrocesso mas enquanto evolução. Hoje falamos de um <em>post-work society</em>, que,  coincidentemente, novamente tece afinidades a eras idas. Segue-se a intro retirada das conclusões do dito: um mundo sem trabalho.</p>
<blockquote> Decades from now, perhaps the 20th century will strike future historians as an aberration, with its religious devotion to overwork in a time of prosperity, its attenuations of family in service to job opportunity, its conflation of income with self-worth. The post-work society (...) in many ways reflects the forgotten norms of the mid-19th century—the artisan middle class, the primacy of local communities, and the unfamiliarity with widespread joblessness.<br>
  <br>
  Entertainment will surely become more immersive and exert a gravitational pull on people without much to do. But if that&rsquo;s all that happens, society will have failed.<br>

<p>À questão pendente - irão os automatismo eliminar ou apenas deslocar profissões - diz-nos o autor:</p>
<blockquote> Technological progress on the scale we&rsquo;re imagining would usher in social and cultural changes that are almost impossible to fully envision.<br>

<p>E, no que importa ao nosso pequeno apontamento de hoje, consequências sobre o trabalho e sociedade decorrente:</p>
<blockquote> The widespread disappearance of work would usher in a social transformation unlike any we&rsquo;ve seen<span class="voice">[:]</span> an era of technological unemployment, in which computer scientists and software engineers essentially invent us out of work, and the total number of jobs declines steadily and permanently.<br>

<p>O mesmo s<em>ame-ol&rsquo;-same-ol&rsquo; / not thiz time aroun</em>&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote> This fear is not new. (...) The end-of-work argument has often been dismissed as the &ldquo;Luddite fallacy&rdquo; (...) But some of the most sober economists are beginning to worry that the Luddites weren&rsquo;t wrong, just premature. 
  <p>Technology could exert a slow but continual downward pressure on the value and availability of work—that is, on wages and on the share of prime-age workers with full-time jobs. Eventually, by degrees, that could create a new normal, where the expectation that work will be a central feature of adult life dissipates for a significant portion of society. After 300 years of people crying wolf, there are now three broad reasons to take seriously the argument that the beast is at the door: the ongoing triumph of capital over labor, the quiet demise of the working man, and the impressive dexterity of information technology.</p>
In the biggest picture, the job market appears to be requiring more and more preparation for a lower and lower starting wage.<br>

After 300 years of breathtaking innovation, people aren&rsquo;t massively unemployed or indentured by machines. But to suggest how this could change, some economists have pointed to the defunct career of the second-most-important species in U.S. economic history: <b>the horse</b>.</div>
<p>E chegados ao <em>core</em>: o esvaziar do trabalho enquanto emprego:</p>
<blockquote> We owe it to ourselves to start thinking about what society could look like without universal work, in an effort to begin nudging it toward the better outcomes and away from the worse ones  <br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;Sooner or later, we will run out of jobs.&rdquo; (...) we ought to think about ways to make it easier and better to not be employed.&rdquo;<br>

<p>E aqui remetemo-nos ao arquivo da peça - futuros comentários quando e se for necessário regressar a <em>framework</em> no intuito das nossas teses. Comecemos com a anedota, construímos sobre ela.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the 1950s, Henry Ford II, the CEO of Ford, and Walter Reuther, the head of the United Auto Workers union, were touring a new engine plant in Cleveland. Ford gestured to a fleet of machines and said, &ldquo;Walter, how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues?&rdquo; The union boss famously replied: &ldquo;Henry, how are you going to get them to buy your cars?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><span class="voice">[The]</span> message is instructive. We&rsquo;re pretty good at noticing the immediate effects of technology&rsquo;s substituting for workers, such as fewer people on the factory floor. What&rsquo;s harder is anticipating the second-order effects of this transformation, such as what happens to the consumer economy when you take away the consumers. Technological progress on the scale we&rsquo;re imagining would usher in social and cultural changes that are almost impossible to fully envision.<br>

I can&rsquo;t stress this enough: this isn&rsquo;t just about economics; it&rsquo;s psychological</div>
<blockquote> &ldquo;The paradox of work&rdquo;: many people are happier complaining about jobs than they are luxuriating in too much leisure (...) often feel worthless when they reflect on their unproductive downtime<span class="voice">[:]</span> contentment speaks in the present tense, but something more—pride—comes only in reflection on past accomplishments.
  <p>Most people want to work, and are miserable when they cannot. The ills of unemployment go well beyond the loss of income; people who lose their job are more likely to suffer from mental and physical ailments. &ldquo;There is a loss of status, a general malaise and demoralization, which appears somatically or psychologically or both,&rdquo; says Ralph Catalano, a public-health professor at UC Berkeley. Research has shown that it is harder to recover from a long bout of joblessness than from losing a loved one or suffering a life-altering injury. The very things that help many people recover from other emotional traumas—a routine, an absorbing distraction, a daily purpose—are not readily available to the unemployed.</p>
One theory of work holds that people tend to see themselves in jobs, careers, or callings. Individuals who say their work is <b>&ldquo;just a job&rdquo;</b> emphasize that they are <b>working for money</b> rather than aligning themselves with any higher purpose. Those with pure <b>careerist</b> <b>ambitions</b> are <b>focused</b> not only on income but also <b>on the status</b> that comes with promotions and the growing renown of their peers. But one <b>pursues a calling</b> not only for pay or status, but also for <b>the intrinsic fulfillment </b>of the work itself.<br>

<blockquote> <b>Work is really three things: the means by which the economy produces goods, the means by which people earn income, and an activity that lends meaning or purpose to many people&rsquo;s lives.</b>
  <p>I see three overlapping possibilities as formal employment opportunities decline. Some people displaced from the formal workforce will devote their freedom to simple leisure; some will seek to build productive communities outside the workplace; and others will fight, passionately and in many cases fruitlessly, to reclaim their productivity by piecing together jobs in an informal economy. These are futures of consumption, communal creativity, and contingency. In any combination, it is almost certain that the country would have to embrace <b>a radical new role for government</b>.<br>

 <i>Communal Creativity - The Artisans&rsquo; Revenge</i></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The next wave of automation returning us to an age of craftsmanship and artistry. </p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s possible that information technology and robots eliminate traditional jobs and make possible a new artisanal economy … an economy geared around self-expression, where people would do artistic things with their time.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>A future not of consumption but of creativity, as technology returns the tools of the assembly line to individuals, democratizing the means of mass production. </p>
  <p>A digitally preoccupied society will come to appreciate the pure and distinct pleasure of making things you can touch. </p>
  <p>The demise of the formal economy could free many would-be artists, writers, and craftspeople to dedicate their time to creative interests—to live as cultural producers. Such activities offer virtues that many organizational psychologists consider central to satisfaction at work: independence, the chance to develop mastery, and a sense of purpose.</p>
  <p>A Cambrian explosion of mega-scale creative and intellectual pursuits, a generation of Wikipedia-scale projects that can ask their users for even deeper commitments.</p>
<span class="voice">[Exemplo de Youngstown] </span>The evaporation of work has deepened the local arts and music scene, several residents told me, because people who are inclined toward the arts have so much time to spend with one another. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a devastatingly poor and hemorrhaging population, but the people who live here are fearless and creative and phenomenal&rdquo;<br>

Today the norm is to think about employment and unemployment as a black-and-white binary, rather than two points at opposite ends of a wide spectrum of working arrangements. As late as the mid-19th century, though, the modern concept of &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t exist (...) The despondency and helplessness of unemployment were discovered, to the bafflement and dismay of cultural critics, only after factory work became dominant and cities swelled. The 21st century (...) could in this respect come to resemble the mid-19th century: an economy marked by episodic work across a range of activities, the loss of any one of which would not make somebody suddenly idle.<br>

I believe the potential consequences to be so great that we should regard automation as the most urgent issue (...) that brings together trades unions, employers and government to establish how the time liberated and wealth created by robots is equitably shared</p>
      <p>The first machine age unleashed the stunning power of capitalism and changed society forever. Our towns and cities are shaped by the industrial revolution. (...) This wave of industrialisation created great wealth, great philanthropy and great advances in the human condition. But it also created huge upheaval and vast misery: child labour; infectious disease; industrial injury; fetid slums; and infant mortality. It took an amalgam of municipal leadership, benevolent capitalism and the collective strength of workers to civilise this new economic landscape. But there were huge changes to the lives of millions. At one point more British soldiers were being deployed to deal with the Luddites who smashed the new machinery than to fight Napoleon.</p>
      <p>Today, sensors and actuators, together with advances in computation, memory and communication capability, are making every product smarter. The results will be positive for the vast mass of the global population, bringing knowledge, connections and consumer choice to billions. But they will be challenging for the millions in jobs that won’t exist in a decade. We already have an hourglass economy, with plenty of room at the top for those with existing wealth and access to capital, and a wide, flat base of lower-paid jobs that cannot be automated. There is a hollowing out of the middle (...) New technology will exacerbate this trend.</p>
      <p>The success of big tech platforms like Google, Amazon and Facebook has seen huge amounts of cash accrue to their balance sheets, but very little investment in social infrastructure, education, skills and health. The situation is worsened by the apparent inability of government to tax these tech giants.</p>

      <p><b>Há uma equação fundamental entre o tempo e o dinheiro que pouca gente se preocupa em resolver.</b></p>
      <p>Um paradoxo com efeitos desastrosos governa aquilo que ainda resta da sociedade do trabalho: há cada vez menos trabalho, mas quem o tem está submetido a ele em excesso.</p>
      <p>Parece que ninguém aceita que o princípio de que “tempo é dinheiro”, popularizado por Benjamin Franklin, deveria determinar o objectivo de ganhar tempo ao tempo perdido do trabalho. Há hoje muita gente (mesmo em lugares onde se presume que existem todos os instrumentos para resistir à “alienação”, por exemplo a Universidade) que aceita fazer trabalho não remunerado porque ficou dependente de uma lógica da expectativa e da promessa que governa a economia e o mundo social. E há os que estão de tal modo presos a um pensamento convencional e naturalizado do tempo de trabalho e do tempo livre, que nem se dão conta de que estão a pagar uma parte substancial do trabalho que fazem.</p>
      <p>Este regime absurdo que faz com que o trabalho só conheça dois regimes extremos, o do excesso e o da falta, afecta todos os assalariados.</p>
      <p>O que é que caracteriza verdadeiramente um presidente ou administrador de uma empresa? É alguém que não tem tempo porque o seu tempo é tão caro que ele o vende todo a preço de ouro. No final, tem sempre muito dinheiro, mas nenhum tempo.</p>
      <p>É certo que ele pode, com a rapidez de um clic, gastar uma fortuna. Mas para gozá-la precisa de tempo. A equação é difícil de resolver, tanto do lado dos que só não têm tempo como do lado dos que não têm tempo nem dinheiro. Uns e outros são igualmente pobres em relação aos que detêm o privilégio não de um sobre-salário, mas do sobretempo. Não são os desempregados os detentores do sobretempo, já que esses ocupam todo o seu tempo à procura de emprego. São os membros de classes já desaparecidas. Se hoje não é concebível que apareça um novo Proust, é porque os escritores já não têm tempo para gastar nem para o procurar.</p>
