<p><small>Tradução automática no Bing para <i>"broader fact-checking efforts</i>. Podia ter corrido muito pior. Do tradutor do Google: <i>"esforços de verificação de factos mais"</i>.</small></p>
<blockquote>
  As part of its broader fact-checking efforts, The Associated Press announced Thursday that it will work with Facebook to help identify and debunk trending “news” stories being shared online that are false.<br><br>
Now, when AP or another participating fact-check organization flags a piece of content as fake, Facebook users will see that it has been disputed and there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. That flag will follow the content if a Facebook user chooses to share it. <br>

</blockquote>
<p>Lembram-se quando <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2016/11/algoritmo-porque-alguns-humanos-sao-tao.html">apontávamos aos media a presunção</a> de se manterem como os guardiões da verdade? <em>Well there u go</em>. Organizações do terceiro partido, ie, o 4º estado, têm agora o seu primeiro momento de verdade, passe a ironia.</p>
<blockquote>     Starting today, Facebook is responding to widespread criticism over the spread of “fake news” by integrating a layer of fact checking into its publication process (...) in what seems like a series of relatively sensible and cautious steps, the fact checking responsibilities have been handed off to third-party organizations.<br>
  <br>
  Is this a PR response to poor optics or a genuine change in product strategy? Both explanations are simultaneously true. (...) the company feels, at a minimum, that it must be seen to be engaging more closely with its shifting role. For the rest of us, this is a turn of the cycle that has as many ramifications for traditional news companies as it does for the technology companies that now replace them. One concrete outcome of the changes is that Facebook is assuming more of the publishing responsibility it has long tried to evade. <br>

<p>  Àparte à comparação do Twitter, um caso especial de redes sociais que <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2016/11/140-chars-ou-menos.html">nos ocupou num <em>post</em> antes</a>.</p>
<div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> The problem is that values cost money, and the hard cases are really very hard indeed. </div>
<blockquote> While Facebook is busy absorbing and learning from lessons of the past, the senior management might want to pay more attention to Twitter. Though Twitter is by Silicon Valley standards a basket case of declining value and complex problems, it is a leading indicator of how social publishing is going to develop now that it has essentially become mainstream media.  <br>
  <br>
  Twitter has been more forthright about its mission of free speech, and has paid a greater price for trying to hold the line that the openness of the platform to all comes before creating a more regulated environment. Unlike Facebook, the trolling and human malware on Twitter was all too obvious, and the platform’s inability or unwillingness to address these issues has wrought long term corporate damage.<br>

<p>Como sempre, importam-nos o alcance de implicações e consequências:</p>
<blockquote> Facebook flagging fake news and Twitter turning down Trump’s hashtag emoji differ in scale, but both count as editorial moves. The business of publishing and monetizing information is never neutral; it is always deeply political. It shapes opinion, informs markets, reinforces biases, creates understanding, and spreads confusion. Facebook has said more than once that it does not want to be an arbiter of the truth, but it also does not want to be the purveyor of lies. Journalists have known for a long time what technologists are just finding out: that what you don’t publish is as brand-defining as what you do.<br>

<p>É importante salientar que a relação entre media e redes sociais e outros gigantes digitais não está pouco-mais-ou-menos sanada, é apenas um compromisso entre frenemies. Seguido ao queixume os jornalistas têm agora o seu quinhão de reconhecimento como reclamado, mas não se iludam sobre quem tem a última palavra.</p>
<blockquote> The relationship (...) involves no compensation, which is consistent with Facebook’s philosophy that the human aspects of curation and editing are better kept at arm’s length, and off the payroll.<br>

<p>  Ou, de um tão adequadamente intitulado <em>&quot;Facebook has a plan to fight fake news. Here’s where we come in&quot;</em>, e onde a bolha começa e acaba:</p>
<blockquote> The company will rely on the code of principles developed by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), an alliance of fact-checkers hosted by Poynter, as one prerequisite to determine whether to verify fact-checkers on its platform.<br>
    <br>
    Facebook has decided that being a signatory to the IFCN code of principles is a &quot;minimum condition&quot; to be verified as a fact-checker on the platform. We are only involved to the extent that Facebook relies on the list of signatories to our code of principles as a starting point for the organizations it chooses to verify. <b>Facebook is the only organization certifying third-party fact-checkers on its platform.</b><br>
