  <h3>The fast demise of the physical   encyclopedia came about thanks to an upstart publisher, an indecisive   giant, and the world&rsquo;s biggest software company.</h3>
  <p><b>$400M</b> The amount of retail sales that encyclopedias were estimated to have driven in 1980, according to statistics from the Book Industry Study Group. The industry at the time was driven by large publishers who would get people to sign up for monthly contracts. The books were sold to the public through retail channels or even salespeople. These books were often costly, but also high-margin, allowing encyclopedia companies to invest in fairly in-depth takes on different kinds of topics.</p>
  <p>The CD-ROM was sold to the public and the world as a way to bring   interactive multimedia experiences into our homes. (Certainly, <a href="https://tedium.co/2016/02/23/cd-rom-magazines-launch-blender/">that&rsquo;s how the magazine world</a> tried to sell it.) But beyond that, it was a sheer amount of storage   for a price that was insane to consider at the time. And that meant that   some of the earliest products produced for the CD-ROM format were of   the reference variety. Specifically, in encyclopedia form. We take   Wikipedia for granted these days, but the encyclopedia on disc was a big   deal—especially because it was both cheaper and smaller than the   alternative. Today&rsquo;s Tedium dives into the history of the electronic   encyclopedia. Eat your heart out, <em>Encarta</em>. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em></p>
The first major CD-ROM encyclopedia publisher was an upstart that forgot the pictures.
<p>Nine million words. 32,000 articles. No photos. No maps.</p>
<p>But then again, it didn&rsquo;t weigh 50 pounds, either.</p>
<p>The first attempt to bring the encyclopedia to a digital format   wasn&rsquo;t flashy or even sexy, but it did solve a bit of a problem with the   original format of the encyclopedia, which was that it was a very bulky   information vessel.</p>
<p>The company that came to the idea first was a firm called Arete   Publishing, a Dutch company that had its sights on taking over the   American market for the first time with its <em>Academic American Encyclopedia</em>.   Over a six-year period, the firm put together a brand-new encyclopedia,   a $20 million investment, with the hope of taking on the big guys   already on the market—namely, <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> and <em>World Book</em>.   The company initially had set sights for its content in the world of   retail, and it wasn&rsquo;t exactly coming at the market with the world&rsquo;s best   sales pitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The retail strategy is a radical and risky one, especially for a   no-name publisher with no domestic experience or brand identity,&rdquo; <a href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1980/07/27/page/63/article/marketing"><em>Chicago Tribune</em> marketing columnist Elizabeth Brenner wrote in 1980</a>. &ldquo;Indeed, in approaching retailers this year, it did not even have a finished product.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately, Arete had an ace up its sleeve: It was much more   flexible about putting its words on different kinds of formats compared   to its more established competition, and it quickly partnered with both   CompuServe and Dow Jones News Service to bring its encyclopedia to   modem-accessible databases as something of an extension of the <a href="https://tedium.co/2016/11/03/online-news-history-compuserve-videotex/">existing newspaper databases on the services</a>. Some felt the offering was broad, but a little skimpy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can get a dab of almost anything you want in CompuServe, but it isn&rsquo;t very substantial,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12351543/chicago_tribune/">syndicated tech columnist Peter McWilliams wrote</a>.   &ldquo;For instance, the encyclopedia gives me only three or four short   paragraph summaries of anything I look up. The movie reviews are longer,   but there are less than 30 reviews at a time. Aren&rsquo;t databases known   for their storage power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By 1984, the company had started experimenting with bringing its   encyclopedia out in optical disc form. We were still in the period   before CD-ROMs were even on the market in any meaningful way, so Arete,   which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/01/business/takeovers-spur-stock-gains.html?mcubz=0">was acquired by the encyclopedia publisher Grolier</a> in 1985, put its energy into getting its multi-volume encyclopedia onto a Laserdisc—<a href="https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/09469/GEP85-010/Knowledge-Disc">something called the <em>Grolier KnowledgeDisc</em></a>.</p>
<p>Even by late 1985 standards, the cost savings compared to a shelf of physical books was fairly impressive, <em>Philadelphia Daily News</em> columnist <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-12-27/entertainment/8503300062_1_laser-disc-laser-videodisc-disc-drive">Jonathan Takiff noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Better still, a user isn&rsquo;t just saving on time, energy and shelf   space by going with the electronic version, but also is saving big   bucks. The printed, 21-volume version of the Academic American costs   $650; the laser disc treatment is $89.95. A Pioneer PR-8210 laser disc   player with remote control goes for about $450, so you&rsquo;re still ahead,   even with the hardware investment. With the laser player, you also wind   up with a wonderful entertainment programming source. There&rsquo;s a rich   library of music and movie titles available on the high-grade and laser   disc medium, at prices lower than videotape equivalents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And remember, Laserdisc was not a cheap medium in the 1980s. But it   still beat out the cost of the physical encyclopedia. Even though the   navigation was being done on remote-driven device rather than something   where you could copy-paste data and quote from it in a report, it was   still better than the alternative in so many ways. Compared to   better-known volumes, the price difference was even more stark. And   Grolier Electronic Publishing knew the direction that things were going   years before any of its competitors did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With our CD-ROM encyclopedia, you&rsquo;ll easily find dozens of   references to a topic, instead of just the obvious three or four,&rdquo; Frank   J. Farrell, the president of Grolier Electronic Publishing, explained   to Takiff. &ldquo;If, say, you want to research German subs, you&rsquo;ll also be   pointed to unexpected references like Ernest Hemingway, who spent two   years hunting German subs on his private yacht. If you&rsquo;re interested in   Oedipus, you&rsquo;ll come up with 34 references, including Thomas Hardy, who   used the Oedipus theme for his first critically acclaimed novel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t win the battle, but it had an impressive head start.</p>

    <h3>&ldquo;We knew from the beginning that we were a temporary business, eventually to be overtaken by the internet.&rdquo;</h3>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>— Tom Corddry,</strong> the head of Microsoft&rsquo;s multimedia projects during the 1990s, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-microsoft-encarta-2015-11">discussing in an interview with <em>Business Insider</em></a> how it approached its reference products, particularly <em>Encarta</em>, which was released in 1993, but also <em>Bookshelf</em>, a program first released in 1987 that integrated reference materials from the <em>World Almanac</em>, the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>, and <em>Bartlett&lsquo;s Familiar Quotations</em>,   among other reference materials. Basically, these products existed as   loss leaders of sorts for Microsoft, ways to ensure that the mainstream   public got hooked on computers. But starting off wasn&rsquo;t cheap or easy: <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=zzAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA5">According to <em>InfoWorld</em></a>, Microsoft agreed to let <em>Bookshelf</em> be bundled with an early CD-ROM in 1987, at a cost of $1,099 for the full package. (Considering the <em>World Almanac</em> <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12352444/the_akron_beacon_journal/">was being sold for less than $6</a> in printed form, it was a tad expensive.)</p>
</div>
<h3>Did the Encyclopaedia Britannica blow the digital revolution?</h3>
<p>As Grolier and Microsoft were basically reinventing the world of   reference materials in the late 1980s, the Encyclopaedia Britannica was   having a pop culture moment.</p>
<p>The company got famed satirist Stan Freberg to do their ads, and   Freberg decided to let his son Donavan, a real smart-alecky kid, do the   selling. The move created the most popular encyclopedia-ad icon ever and   arguably made giant multi-part research book libraries kind of cool for   a couple of years.</p>
<p>But in the midst of all this success, the Encyclopaedia Britannica   folks got a nudge from Microsoft—hey, we&rsquo;re working on a multimedia   encyclopedia, it&rsquo;s going to be really awesome and highlight your work in   the most impressive possible light; you want in?</p>
<p>Sounds like a good idea, but there was a problem. The Britannica folks had hooked families <a href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-12-14/business/0090100181_1_set-of-encyclopedias-encyclopaedia-britannica">onto $1,400 investments</a> with Donavan Freberg&rsquo;s help. (And that&rsquo;s in 1988 money; it&rsquo;d be worth   $2,900 today, or the price of a 15-inch MacBook Pro with some of the   upgrades checked off.)</p>
<p>Also a factor was the fact that, Britannica did have a footprint in   the multimedia space at the time: For years, it owned the Compton   encyclopedia brand, which beat Grolier to having a fully multimedia   CD-ROM experience. According to Joseph Esposito, who served at   Britannica&rsquo;s CEO during the mid-&rsquo;90s, Microsoft wanted Compton, but his   colleague Dr. Stanley Frank would not sell it to them.</p>
<p>(Encyclopaedia Britannica eventually <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12353141/south_florida_sun_sentinel/">sold Compton to Tribune Corp. in 1993</a>, a move driven by the company&rsquo;s financial challenges at the time.)</p>
<p>While Microsoft Encarta probably would have been a better work with   the contents of the best encyclopedia, what they got instead—a deal with   Funk &amp; Wagnalls, the Coldplay of encyclopedias—was good enough.</p>
<p>A 1994 piece <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-07-04/business/1994185090_1_print-encyclopedias-cd-rom-encyclopedias-britannica">published on the Knight-Ridder News Service</a> noted that Encarta quickly usurped the competition, and was also   starting to affect sales of printed encyclopedias. It&rsquo;s easy to   understand why: For the price of a high-end encyclopedia set, you could   get a computer that could run an encyclopedia app <em>and</em> basically everything else under the sun.</p>
<p>Jack Dailey, the group president of World Book Educational Product,   put matters bluntly: &ldquo;We think World Book is the Cadillac of   encyclopedias. We&rsquo;re not going to sell it like a Yugo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The problem was that World Book and Britannica were not trying to   sell Cadillacs, but rather fast horses that weren&rsquo;t designed to drive   down the information superhighway. And eventually, it caught up with   them.</p>
<p><em>Encyclopaedia Britannica</em> made a belated 1994 debut on the market, pricing its CD-ROM at $995, ten times the price of <em>Encarta</em> at the time. This result did not come from a position of strength: In   1994, the company sold just 51,000 print sets, less than half what it   sold just four years earlier, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/16/business/slow-to-adapt-encyclopaedia-britannica-is-for-sale.html">according to <em>The New York Times</em></a>. By 1995, the company had put itself up for sale, and the price of the digital <em>Britannica</em> <a href="https://www.questia.com/magazine/1P3-12672737/encyclopedia-britannica-lowers-price-of-britannica">suddenly went through the floor</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Microsoft and the dawning of the CD-ROM presented a company like   Britannica with an awful choice: it was damned if it replaced its   premier product with technology that dramatically lowered production   costs and thereby angered its sales staff—but it was damned too, as it   found out painfully, if it did not cooperate in the development of the   new medium,&rdquo; author Randall E. Stross <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jrKwMK3raXoC&pg=PA80">wrote</a> in 1997&rsquo;s <a href="https://amzn.to/2ugjvLP"><em>The Microsoft Way: The Real Story Of How The Company Outsmarts Its Competition</em></a>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the common telling of this story, and one favorable to   Microsoft. But to hear it from Esposito, Encyclopaedia Britannica had   basically passed up the CD-ROM, instead choosing to put its energies   more toward the internet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A colleague told me that the University of Chicago had set up a   local area network. We got the idea to put EB on the network as a test,&rdquo;   he explained in an email. &ldquo;While the development was going on (March   1993), the head of development faxed (literally faxed) me a one-sentence   memo: Have you ever heard of the Internet? Of course, I hadn&rsquo;t, but   within 30 days we moved our development team to the Internet product, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/business/44-million-words-strong-britannica-to-join-internet.html">which we launched in October 1994</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esposito said that, as a result of these efforts, the company chose   to largely sideline CD-ROMs as a part of its digital strategy—and when   Microsoft took another stab at purchasing the company&rsquo;s content while   the firm was up for sale, he said the tech giant was skeptical of the   internet&rsquo;s long-term potential. (They didn&rsquo;t sell to Microsoft.)   Esposito, likewise, was skeptical of CD-ROMs, due to the fact that discs   were being bundled with computers, taking a once-expensive product and   giving it away for free. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=sDTitglU9BoC&pg=PA129">In a 1997 essay on the matter</a>, he put a lot of blame on this bundling for breaking the market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reference materials on CD-ROM are being &lsquo;bundled&rsquo; in order to   advance the claims of technology companies (principally Microsoft) to   the standard platform for electronic publishing,&rdquo; he wrote at the time.   &ldquo;This has resulted in a dramatic restructuring of many segments of the   reference marketplace. There is no turning back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(So why did this part of the story get buried during the &rsquo;90s?   Esposito notes that the press coverage was brutal during the era, and   largely favorable of the newer technologies. &ldquo;EB had plenty of problems,   but digital strategy was not one of them,&rdquo; he said.)</p>
<p>Like Britannica, World Book also was late to the digital revolution,   but at least one person involved with its production figured things out   quick: Peter Mollman, an executive that had turned down Microsoft&rsquo;s   overtures to acquire <em>World Book</em> text for <em>Encarta</em>, signed on to work as an executive for Microsoft.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2uYDqwf">World Book still prints books</a>. <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/the_encyclopedia_britannica_was_expensive_useless_and_exploitative_i_m_glad_it_s_gone_.html">Britannica doesn&rsquo;t</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Now, Encyclopaedia Britannica certainly didn&rsquo;t thrive in the 1990s.</strong> But it based on its continued existence, it chose wisely at the time:   Unlike each of its competitors that teamed with Microsoft, it made it to   the present day.</p>
<p>Funk &amp; Wagnalls, which stopped publishing its encyclopedia in the   late &rsquo;90s, was eventually purchased by World Book, and Microsoft   eventually replaced its <em>Encarta</em> text <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1998/feb/09/business/fi-17136">with entries from <em>Collier&rsquo;s</em></a>,   an encyclopedia that has not produced a print edition since that 1998   deal went down. Macmillian, likewise, has failed to publish more   editions of the <em>New Merit Scholar&rsquo;s Encyclopedia</em> since Microsoft came knocking.</p>
<p>(Even Grolier, which was purchased by Scholastic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/15/business/scholastic-is-planning-to-buy-grolier.html?mcubz=0">in 2000 for $400 million</a>, has survived to the present day <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/digital/#go">in the form of this search engine</a>.)</p>
<p>And in the end, what was it all for? Microsoft <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-closing-the-book-on-encarta/">dropped an entire industry worth of information with a thud in 2009</a>,   16 years after changing the encyclopedia industry forever. Wikipedia   happened, yes, but there were other ways for Microsoft to handle the   problem of dealing with this store of information, much of which it   owned outright.</p>
<p>Handing its work to the research community would have been a great   option, as would have spinning off the product as an open-source   project. It did neither of these things, despite literally having   billions of dollars at its disposal—and we shouldn&rsquo;t forget that.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.britannica.com/">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a> can&rsquo;t compete with the likes of Wikipedia, the fact that it was forced   to go its own way has ensured that it maintains a voice into the present   day, that it was able to remake its own business model in a way that   kept up with the times suggests that for all the pain it dealt with way   back when, not working with Microsoft was the right move.</p>
<p>Going to <a href="http://www.encarta.com/">Encarta.com</a> in 2017 loads up a Bing search for Encarta. The first result is the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Encarta">Encarta Wikipedia page</a>. The second result is <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Encarta">the Encyclopaedia Britannica page</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft was never in it for the history.</p>
