  <p><em>&quot;E um dia  depois...!&quot;</em>: adenda. Ontem&nbsp;notávamos&nbsp;que  o <em><b>SB Nation</b></em> publicou uma peça à qual<a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/07/this-is-punk.html"> não tivemos hesitações</a> de&nbsp;intitular&nbsp;de &quot;punk&quot;, uma referência a fechar um texto de  vários tópicos cruzados. <em>Well, u know,</em> coincidências-e-somos-bons: hoje  <sup>(*) </sup>a <b><em>Poynter</em></b> destaca os destaques ao <b><em>&quot;17776&quot;</em></b> entre jornaleiros:</p>
 <div class="info coluna"> <p><small>*O artigo  foi publicado no dia 10 à-lá-América, ie, na nossa madrugada de 10 para 11, um dia  depois do nosso dia 10... &nbsp;</small></p></div>
  <blockquote> Journalists from all different kinds of publishers lauded the radical piece  of fiction on Twitter, saying that it's strangely beautiful and definitely not  would you'd expect from SB Nation.<br><small>in <a href="http://www.poynter.org/2017/this-sb-nation-story-has-everything-robots-football-and-2-3-million-pageviews/466041/" target="_blank"><em>&quot;This SB Nation story has everything: Robots, football&nbsp;and 2.3  million pageviews&quot;</em></a> <sup>10 jul 2017</sup></small>  </blockquote>
  <p><b>OS POSITIVOS:</b><em> yeah, we got it</em>.</p>
  <p>Da descrição:</p>
  <blockquote> It starts with a long paragraph containing only one sentence —  &quot;Something is terribly wrong.&quot; — and by the time you finish reading  it, you're more confused than when you started. But that's the point of SB  Nation's<strong> latest subversive experiment</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    The project, titled &quot;17776&quot; (that's nearly 16,000 years in the  future), takes readers from a seemingly innocent landing page about the future  of football and rockets them through a surreal, science fiction-like trip. The  piece is immersive, force-filling the reader's screen with text and manually  loading each new element as they progress through the jarring narrative, which  is just that — a narrative.<br>

  <p>E onde a todos toca. Primeiro, eles: futuro dos media.</p>
  <blockquote> So why would a Vox Media-owned sports news site publish a provocative web  experience about robots and football? &quot;The goal as conceived was to give  the reader a good time,&quot; said Jon Bois, creator of the project.<br>

  <p>Sim, mas  isso mais qualquer coisinha.</p>
  <blockquote> As of Monday, &quot;17776&quot; had massive reader engagement. The project  has had more than <b>2.3 million pageviews</b> since its publication and an<b> average  engagement time of more than 9 minutes</b>. About 43 percent of readers — of which  more than half are viewing the piece on mobile devices — had finished each installment  of the series as of Friday.<br>

  <p>Essa  qualquer coisinha. Dois, nós, <em>webcomics</em>:</p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> &quot;By scrolling they’re doing work by having to access it.&quot;</div>
  <blockquote>     Two things that make &quot;17776&quot; so immersive and engaging are its <b>infinite  scroll</b> and <b>dynamic loading</b> aspects. Each installment of the  storyline is contained on one web page, with new graphics, videos and GIFs  loading in real-time as you scroll.<br>

  <p><em>Last not  least</em>, também de  ontem recordávamos a propósito de punk: <em><b>&quot;quem assimila quem&quot;</b></em> ?  Ponto para eles: um&nbsp;<em>&quot;Vox Media-owned sports news site</em>&quot; a usar do <em>punk</em> para <em>hits</em> e <b>$$$</b>.</p>
