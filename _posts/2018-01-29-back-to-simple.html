    <p><b>One of my favorite parts of comics culture is the scrounging for back-issues, which often feels like trying to find a lost wedding band in yesterday’s garbage—in a good way. I get a sincere rush from <strong>finding wacky crap from comic’s past</strong>.</b></p>

    <p>In a recent back-issue find, Kull the Destroyer #19 (1976), there’s this (...) very campy, classic mid-seventies Marvel stuff that the staff at The Comics Journal would have used as toilet paper. To read this comic in any way as to understand the narrative is a fool’s errand, and not worth the time of intelligent, discerning people. Yet! the images will not leave my mind! I find myself returning and going back over.</p>
    <p>Old dumb boy adventure comics featuring superheroes, barbarians and flights of action-packed fever-dreams tend to fall into the “Minor Prophets” category of the comics “Bible.” When all the history of comics is laid before us, it’s comics like Kull the Destroyer #19 that tend to get ignored for various reasons; but it’s these very kinds of comics that <strong>tend to infest our subconscious and become active images in our memory when least expected</strong>.<br>

  <p>Hum, não foi por aqui <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2018/01/but-is-it-art.html">que começámos</a>? E não se acuse <i>"fanboy"</i> ao ar, mesma peça, algum <i>name droppin'</i> para respeito às artes. De <i>"one of the art form’s most important figures"</i>,<b> Chris Ware</b>, a propósito de outro nome habitual desta forma de arte:</p>

<blockquote>
[<b>Daniel Clowes</b>] will draw things in a certain way, especially in his more recent work, that is very uncomfortable or strange. I know he’s looked at comics by cartoonists who might be considered awkward or almost naive just as a way of making an image that has–as I think of it, personally–hooks that hang in your brain and stay with you.<br>

<p>De volta ao simples, e de volta ao inferno. Do dia seguinte, <b>TCJ</b>, a propósito do seu recente <em>Monograph</em>, memórias:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There was a great deal of contextual work done to set the artifice of Ware’s make-believe ACME Novelty Company (the organization ostensibly ‘behind’ his comics) against what I readily understood to be wildly uncommercial and very personal comics. This was not simple irony to me. This was a comic book that seemed to <b>evoke the very history of printed entertainment</b>, to reveal it, systemically, as first a means of forestalling the signal of human pain, and then as a means of enunciating that pain. A hellish memory palace.<br>

<p>De memórias, inferno, cultura de massas <em>lowbrow</em> e Chris(to) da referências <em>arsty</em>, de um autor enunciado das demais vezes como expoente da forma - ele próprio pratica o que prega -, última nota.</p>
<div class="info coluna">
<blockquote>
  <p> Ware quotes the artist <b>Chris Lanier</b> on this topic: &ldquo;I got into comics because in the &rsquo;80s and &rsquo;90s everything sucked. Movies sucked. TV sucked. Music sucked. The only thing that didn&rsquo;t suck quite as much were alternative and underground comics, which had <strong>a direct and unpretentious connection to something human and real</strong> that everything else didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br>
