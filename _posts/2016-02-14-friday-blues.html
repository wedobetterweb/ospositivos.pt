<h3>A última parte do "The TCJ 2015 Year-in-Review" foi publicada hoje.</h3>

<p>Começa assim:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rumors circulated in September that UK Prime Minister David Cameron had fucked a dead pig’s mouth while a student at Oxford.</p>
<p>Cameron’s (alleged) pig-fucking had little-to-nothing to do with the comic industry, however, and so there’s no earthly reason whatsoever to mention David Cameron’s (alleged) hot, sweaty sexual intercourse with a dead pig.</p>
<p>And yet, I can’t help but think that it’s worth noting in an article about comic books that David Cameron’s semi-erect penis might very well have glided firmly into a dead pig’s mouth, if for no other reason than because while (allegedly) face-fucking the dead pig, maybe David Cameron thought about Spider-Man’s porcine alter-ego Peter Porker, Spider-Ham. It’s possible!</p>
<p>the implications to the comics industry of David Cameron rhythmically pounding his tiny curse into a deceased swine. After all, what would that say about all of us, you, me, that (alleged) pig-fucker David Cameron, all of us, that we all share Peter Porke,r Spider-Ham as a reference point — in Cameron’s (alleged) case, as a reference point for where to put his (alleged) penis?</p>
<p>We should all give this a great deal of thought, except for the poor pig who’s been through enough (allegedly).</p>

<p>Encontrámos um <i>kindred spirit</i> - esperamos estar à altura de servir igualmente bem os cómicos nacionais quando voltarmos com o <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2015/08/critics-criticism.html"><b>Comics et al</b></a>, se o pudor não nos envergonhar - hint: it wont!</p>
