    <blockquote> These tools shape the course of events and social movements in often  unpredictable ways. The contradictory and sometimes counterintuitive dynamics  unleashed by the emergence of the printing press demonstrate all too clearly  that there is little that is straightforward about the implications of a  revolutionary communications technology.<br>

Ontem terminávamos com a advertência  na Primavera Árabe: as redes sociais foram parte mas apenas a mais visível e  não necessariamente a mais relevante. Advertência feita, continua a ser um caso  de estudo para o seu impacto em momentos de ruptura e -razão pela qual fica o  registo feito- como o velho e o novo se relacionam.</p>

  <div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> Throughout the 18 days of the initial Tahrir uprising, I turned on the  television only once.</div>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> Digital networks allowing the protesters to broadcast to the world <b>raised  the costs of repression</b> through attention from a sympathetic global public.</div>
  <blockquote> The world followed the uprising through the Facebook and Twitter posts of  young, digitally savvy and determined protesters. Digital technologies had  clearly transformed the landscape, seemingly to the benefit of political  challengers - activists were able to overcome censorship, coordinate protests,  organize logistics, and spread humor and dissent with an ease that would have  seemed miraculous to earlier generations.<br>
    <br>
    Digital connectivity had warped time and space, transforming that square  into a crossroads of attention and visibility, both interpersonal and  interactive, not just something filtered through mass media.&nbsp;CNN was  broadcasting an aerial shot of the square: the camera angle from far above the  square was jarring because I had been following it all on Twitter, person by  person, each view necessarily incomplete but also intimate. On television, all  I could see was an undifferentiated mass of people, an indistinct crowd. It  felt cold and alienating.<br>

  <div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> The Internet’s capabilities have changed greatly during the past two  decades.</div>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> Networked protests of the 21st century differ in important ways from  movements of the past and often operate with a different logic </div>
  <blockquote> Many of  these developments have cultural and political roots that predate the Internet  but have found a fuller expression in conjunction with the capabilities  provided by technology.&nbsp;In the 1990s the ability to cheaply and easily  connect on a global scale was already emerging and was transforming social  movements. The Internet may have been slow and available only in offices and  homes (since phones did not have Internet then), but the protest and movement  culture that flourished in the 1990s already displayed many cultural elements  that would persist. <br>
    <br>
    These movements shared an intense focus on <b>participation</b> and <b>horizontalism</b>—functioning <b>without formal hierarchies</b> or <b>leaders</b> and using a digitally supported, <b>ad hoc approach</b> to organizing  infrastructure and tasks.&nbsp;<b>Digital technology was used to support  organization in the absence of formal structures.</b> An alternative social  space was created, and it felt like, and was celebrated as a new form of  politics. These elements would reappear in protester camps and prolonged  occupations of public spaces worldwide in the next decades and would become  thoroughly intertwined with digital technologies.<br>

  <p>Na peça  tocam numa daquelas causas fracturantes -exasperante- de qualquer movimento de  rua: organização, e líderes. A tecnologia é uma forma mais eficiente de fazer  algo, mas&nbsp; quando o problema é conceptual - ie, humano- a <em>tech</em> é  irrelevante. <em>Same ol', same ol'</em>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I have also  seen movement after movement falter because of a lack of organizational depth  and experience, of tools or culture for collective decision making, and  strategic, long-term action. The capabilities that fueled their organizing  prowess sometimes also set the stage for what later tripped them up, especially  when they were unable to engage in the tactical and decision-making maneuvers  all movements must master to survive.<br>

  <blockquote> For example,  the ability to use digital tools to rapidly amass large numbers of protesters  with a common goal empowers movements. Once this large group is formed,  however, it struggles because it has sidestepped some of the traditional tasks  of organizing. Besides taking care of tasks, the drudgery of traditional  organizing helps create collective decision-making capabilities, sometimes  through formal and informal leadership structures. The expressive, often  humorous style of networked protests attracts many participants and thrives  both online and offline, but movements falter in the long term unless they  create the capacity to navigate the inevitable challenges.<br>
    These  movements rely heavily on online platforms and digital tools for organizing and  publicity and proclaim that they are leaderless although their practice is  almost always muddier. The open participation afforded by social media does not  always mean equal participation, and it certainly does not mean a smooth  process. Over time a few people emerge as spokesperson, [and] often have great  influence, though they lack the formal legitimacy that an open and recognized  process of selecting leaders would generate. The result is often a  conflict-ridden, drawn-out struggle between those who find themselves running  things (or being treated as de facto leaders) and other people in the movement  who can also express themselves online.<br>

    <p>E igualmente  uma nota para o <em>&quot;slacktivism&quot;</em>. Somos críticos -ver <i>"neo-anarquistas"</i> no castelo dos vampiros-, mas às vezes não é assim  tão fácil como parece.</p>
    <div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> In a  repressive country, tweeting may be a very brave act, while marching in the  streets may present few difficulties in a more advanced democracy. </div>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Sometimes,  networked online political action is derided as &quot;slacktivism&quot; or &quot;clicktivism,&quot;  terms that suggest easy action requiring little effort or commitment. At other  times, people assume that movements fueled by social media are organized by  people with &quot;weak ties&quot;—people we do not know well—unlike protests of the  past. However, these perspectives assume that people who connect online  are doing things only online, and that the online world is somehow less real  than, and disconnected from, the offline one. In contrast, people nowadays also  join protests with people with whom they have &quot;strong ties&quot;—family and close  friends—and people connect online with other people with whom they have both  weak and strong ties. Symbolic action online is not necessarily without power  either—rather, <b>the effect depends on the context</b>. Over time, such  signals are part of what makes social change possible by changing culture. Many  protesters I talked with cite their online political interactions as the  beginning of their process of becoming politicized.<br>

  <p>De volta à  filha-da-putice,&nbsp;<b><em>&quot;How Governments Strike Back&quot;.</em></b></p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> If the  politics of protest do not look like those of the past, neither do some of the  obstacles the protesters face.</div>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> Whereas a  social movement has to persuade people to act, a government or a powerful group  defending the status quo <b>only has to create enough confusion to paralyze  people</b>. The Internet’s relatively chaotic nature, with its surfeit of  information and weak gatekeepers, can asymmetrically empower governments by  allowing them to develop new forms of censorship based not on blocking  information, but <b>on making available information unusable</b>. </div>
  <blockquote> Edward  Snowden revealed the existence of a massive US government surveillance program,  [and] the US is almost certainly not the only government to surveil at large  scale. Governments have learned to control the networked public sphere through  a set of policies more suited to the new era. Surveillance and repression do  not operate primarily in the way that our pre-digital worries might have  forecast. Rather than a complete totalitarianism based on fear and the blocking  of information, the newer methods include demonizing online media and  mobilizing armies of supporters or paid employees who <b>muddy the online  waters with misinformation, information overload, doubt, confusion, harasment,  and distraction</b>. This in turn makes it hard for ordinary people to navigate  the networked public sphere and <b>sort facts from fiction</b>, truth from  hoaxes. Rather than acting directly on dissidents&rsquo; political communications,  many governments try to embarrass or harass activists by hacking and releasing  their personal and private information. If anything, <b>Aldous Huxley&rsquo;s Brave  New World</b> appears more prescient than <b>Orwell&rsquo;s 1984</b>.<br>

  <div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> We  have likely just begun to see what it may all mean.</div>
  <blockquote> But  movements can also use these very platforms to further their goals, as these  technologies allow people to find one another, to craft and amplify their own  narrative, to reach out to broader publics, and to organize and resist. <b>Movements  are making their own history, but in circumstances and with tools not entirely  of their own choosing</b>. <br>
