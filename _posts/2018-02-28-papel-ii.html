<h1 class="subtitle">How paper folds</h1>
<div class="coluna">
  <p>Ficámos <a href="https://www.ospositivos.com/2018/02/papel-i.html">na nostalgia</a>. Desta e a caminho dos arquivos <a href="https://www.ospositivos.com/2017/04/aqui-ha-festa.html">-<em>yet again</em>-</a> ainda o papel, por linhas tortas. Caso: enciclopédias <em>et</em> dicionário, o arquivo papel por excelência. </p>
<blockquote><h3> Words  are only added; they are never deleted.</h3></blockquote>
  <p>Das  leituras longas que este mês encontraram relevância suficiente entre o <em>geist</em> para borbulhar à superfície, cruzado  com <em>refs</em> mais antigas porque tudo anda ligado...</p>
  <p> Antes, <em>imagine all tha people</em> para efeitos de <em>setup:</em></p>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote>
      <p> Imagine that, instead of paper, the computer and all its accoutrements came first. In a flash of divine perception, a Chinese castrate under Ho Ti’s reign conceives of binary systems, electronic circuits, vacuum tubes, capacitors, Boolean logic, transistors, integrated circuits, microprocessors, keyboards, floppy disks, CD-ROMs, zip drives, HTML, CSS, Javascript, modems, routers, email, wifi, AoL, Google, Friendster, Napster, Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, gifs – all at once. And so, for nearly two millennia, the human race lives in a paperless, digital world.</p>
      <p> Then, sometime in the middle of the 20th century, scientists at MIT, Stanford and the US Department of Defense begin to search for a better way to store and share their ideas. They experiment with mashing up old rags and wood to mix with water, draining the mixture through a screen and drying the matted fibres into sheets. The breakthrough makes its way into civilian life, and by the turn of the millennium most people in the developed world carry a pad of paper in their pocket.</p>
      <p> Perhaps, in this version of events, we would regard paper as the superior technology, and not just because of novelty. After all, paper loads instantly. It requires no software, no battery, no power source. It is remarkably lightweight, thin and made from abundant, recyclable materials. Its design is minimalist, understated, calm.<br>

  <p>Onde nos toca: o <em>hardline</em> da coisa obviamente, mas também  como seu imenso esforço é exemplo de intersecções <em>tech</em> aos suportes que nos ocupam. O  problema de registar em papel o que não está morto ainda:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>By the time  it was published in 1928, this Victorian leviathan was already hopelessly out  of date. The A-C entries were compiled nearly 50 years earlier; others relied  on scholarship that had long been surpassed, especially in technology and  science. The only solution was to patch it up. The first Supplement to the OED  came out in 1933. Supplements to that Supplement were begun in 1957. Yet it was  a losing battle, the closer that OED lexicographers got to the finish line, the  more distant that finish line seemed to be.<br>

  <p><em>Enter tha  webs.</em></p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> The  fact that so much text is now available online has been the most cataclysmic  change.</div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>By  astonishing coincidence, another earthquake, far bigger, struck the very same  month that OED2 appeared in print: a proposal by an English computer scientist  named Tim Berners-Lee for &quot;a large hypertext database with typed links&quot;. The  world wide web. Databases could be shared, and connected to one another; whole  libraries of books could be scanned and their contents made searchable. The sum  of human text was starting to become available to anyone with a computer and a  modem.</p>
    <p>For OED&rsquo;s  editors, this world is both exhilarating and, one senses, mildly overwhelming.  The digital era has enabled Oxford lexicographers to run dragnets deeper and  deeper through the language, but it has also <b>threatened to capsize the  operation</b>.<br>

  <p><em>Yadda yadda yadda</em> alguns anos depois, o uso de enciclopédias  está lá em cima -baixo- como a fotografia em rolo. </p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> A  story that has become wearily familiar</div>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Almost no  one wants to shell out. Sales of hard-copy dictionaries have collapsed, far  more calamitously than in other sectors.
      Most  people, of course, now never go near a dictionary, but simply type phrases into  Wikipedia. Dictionaries have been far too slow to adjust. Information-retrieval  is changing so fast. Why don&rsquo;t dictionaries respond intelligently to the  semantic or user context?</p>
    <p>Information  giants such as Google and Apple get fat by using our own search terms to sell  us stuff. If you can get a definition by holding your thumb over a word on your  smartphone, why bother picking up a book?<br>

    <p>&quot;Go to a  dictionary conference these days and you see scared-looking people,&quot; Rundell  said. &quot;It used to be a career,&quot; he went on. &quot;But there just aren&rsquo;t the jobs  there were 30 years ago.&quot; He pointed to his shelves, which were strikingly  bare. <strong>&quot;But then I&rsquo;m not sentimental about print; I gave most of my  dictionaries away.&quot;</strong><br>

  <p>Moral de fábula nesta realidade que o papel precedeu o digital:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> These days  OED issues online updates four times a year; <b>though it has not officially  abandoned the idea of another print edition, that idea is fading</b>.<br>
