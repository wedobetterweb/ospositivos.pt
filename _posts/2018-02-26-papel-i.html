    <p><b>Bookstore  Sales Fell 3.6% in 2017</b></p>
    <p>A slump in the second half  of 2017 led a decline in bookstore sales in 2017 compared to 2016.  After rising in the first part of 2017 over  2016, bookstore sales ended 2017 on a five-month losing streak, capped by a  very soft December. The sales decline in 2017 came after bookstore sales rose in 2016 over 2015, the first annual increase in eight  years.<br>

  <blockquote>
    <p> The introduction of new e-commerce, digital substitution for products, and other technologies, are transforming the industry. Consumers increasingly use the internet and other electronic media to purchase goods and services, pay bills, and obtain electronic versions of printed materials. Moreover, advertisers increasingly use the internet and other electronic media for targeted campaigns directed at specific consumer segments rather than mail campaigns. 
      As society has become increasingly dependent on digital technology products such as laptops, smartphones, and tablet computers, spending on advertising and magazine circulation has eroded, resulting in an <b>overall decline in the demand for paper products,</b> and in-turn lowering reliance on certain of Cenveo’s print marketing business. </p>
    <p>In addition, there is generally a decline in supply of paper products in the industry, such that<b> only a handful of paper mills</b> control the majority of the paper supply. <br>

  <blockquote>
    <p> Cenveo Inc., one of the largest printing businesses in the world, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, citing internet challenges that have wrecked its business model.</p>
    <p>It is the nation’s fourth-largest commercial printer, producing catalogs, annual reports, brochures, <b>comic books</b>, magazines, specialty books and scholarly publications <span class="voice">[and]</span> cash register receipt rolls and labels for packaging and pharmaceuticals.</p>
    <p>The company blames its troubles on e-commerce, digital subscriptions and other technologies that are transforming the industry. As advertisers shift to electronic media, envelopes for mail campaigns are in less demand. Lower magazine circulation has depressed printing revenue. In general, Zameli said, there is less need for paper products.<br>

    <p><b>The global demand for printing and writing (P&amp;W) paper has been in steady decline since 2008</b>. These are the papers most of us think of when we think of paper: the uncoated mechanicals, the uncoated freesheets and woodfree, the coated mechanicals and coated woodfree, the coated freesheets – ie, what composes directories, paperback books, newspaper inserts, low-end magazines and catalogues, direct (junk) mail, envelopes, brochures, photo printing, menus, posters, stationery, legal forms, and the iconic 8.5in by 11in office copy paper. They are suffering the combined assault of social media, email, tablets, e-billing, e-readers, laptops, smartphones, online forms, banner ads etc. Worldwide demand for P&amp;W paper fell by 2.6% in 2015, according to RISI. Preliminary data suggests it fell by 2.2% in 2016, and RISI forecasts it will continue to fall by another 1.1% in 2017 and 2018.</p>

    <p>Market trends session No 2 focused on global paper-based packaging and recovered fibre, where the outlook is much brighter. There is talk of an &quot;Amazon effect&quot;, paired with a slide showing several boxes within boxes and paper padding used to ship one tiny bottle of vitamins. Big Paper is learning to sustain itself by encasing e-commerce gold. <b>The internet taketh away, and the internet giveth.</b></p>
    <p>You’re seeing more paper in food and drink packaging, too <span class="voice">['cuz of]</span> increasingly negative public attitudes toward plastic packaging. And then there’s tissue. It may not be the first thing we think of when we think of paper, but Big Paper is indeed very much in the business of selling toilet paper, facial tissue, paper towels and &quot;feminine products&quot; – and business is good.</p>
    <p>Paper will survive in some form (packaging, toilet paper etc). Meanwhile, as writers fret about the battle between digital and paper, the industry is shifting.<br>

    <p>The set is cluttered with the detritus of obsolete objects, such as a writing desk with a set of plans, various papers, and two typewriters. The floor is scattered with books, map cases and a globe of the world. Grishkovets periodically opens one or more of the doors behind him to reveal objects that supply visual reinforcements to his scenarios of loss. 
      As well as paper, there are farewells to many other things, such as the traditions and the technologies of a previous age. These include things such as quill pens, pen knives, blotting paper, inkwells, the handwritten letter, letter openers, telegrams, and more.</p>

    <p>What becomes obvious is that these previous technologies enforced a need to compose, and a time to reflect. 
      The author is invoking a sense of a deeper nostalgia and regret for the &quot;signs of time past, or of times that are passing&quot;. 
      As well as being a meditation on times past and the fears raised by the dizzying turnover of technologies, there is also a key message here about the importance of patience.<br>

  <blockquote>
    <p> Grishkovets often focuses on the visual, the tactile, the aural and the olfactory aspects of paper technology. Do you appreciate the weight of a book, and the texture of its cover, of its pages? Can you savour the smell of a book – and its dust? Can you enjoy the smell of newsprint, the rustle of a newspaper? Can you savour the smell of an smart phone? Does an iPad rustle?</p>
