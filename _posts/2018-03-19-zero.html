  <p>"I remember when she was 11, she protected a bumblebee from being tormented by other kids at school. She did it with such strength of will that they ridiculed her. But she didn&rsquo;t care." Dirk Campbell said his daughter had dedicated her life to the fight against &quot;unjust power and privilege&quot;. He said she was a committed human rights and environmental campaigner who would &quot;put herself on the line for what she believed in&quot;. A &quot;beautiful and loving daughter&quot; who &quot;would go to any lengths to create the world that she believed in&quot;. <br>

<p>Talvez porque queremos incutir nos nossos filhos a vontade de lutar contra o que lhes choca mas não esperamos que sejam travados por um míssil caído do céu.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Anna Campbell, from Lewes, East Sussex, was volunteering with the US-backed Kurdish Women&rsquo;s Protection Units (YPJ) – the all-female affiliate army of the People&rsquo;s Protection Units (YPG) – in the besieged city of Afrin when the convoy she was travelling in was struck by a Turkish missile on 16 March. <br>

<p>Ou talvez porque nesta frase resumem simbolicamente o combate literal por uma sociedade melhor. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Campbell completed the YPJ&rsquo;s mandatory month-long military training course, in which new recruits learn basic Kurdish, weaponry and battlefield tactics on top of a crash course in <strong>the egalitarian and feminist ideology</strong>. <br />

    The revolution in Rojava is not perfect, but no revolution is. It is however, a growing bastion of hope for a Middle East not torn apart by ethnic and religious division, ecocide, war, and authoritarian regimes of all stripes. Instead, it is a beacon of possibility, based on communalism, autonomy, and freedom.<br>
