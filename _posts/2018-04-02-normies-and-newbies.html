  <h1 class="subtitle">The Missing Building Blocks of the  Web </h1>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Old-timers  might remember when Flash ruled the web, and people made simple games or  interactive art pieces that would then get shared on blogs or other media  sites.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>...e da <i>web</i> do antigamente para o presente. <i>Webdev's</i>, blogs, media, artistas, <i>comix et punx, </i> um <i>recap</i> rápido quase a terminar mais este capítulo.</p>

  <p>Não o dizem, dizemos nós: <a href="https://www.ospositivos.com/2018/03/tariff-hurt-its-in-tha-mail.html">saídos do papel</a> e em modo <strong>DIY</strong>, as <em>calls</em> pelo faz-tu-mesmo <em>online</em> têm novo alento no  pós-última-quebra-de-confiança-do-<em><b>Facebook</b></em> (inserir ali o caso-em-dia no  momento da leitura). Destacamos a que se segue, onde sobressaem dois conceitos que  gravitam de perto as nossas sensibilidades zinescas: <em><b>view source</b></em> + <em><b>authoring</b></em>.  Segue-se o vosso <em>mashup</em> <sup>(*)</sup>:</p>
  <p><small><em>*) Funny enough</em>, publicado no <em><b>Medium</b></em>. </small></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Your own  website at your own address</b></p>
    <p> The web was  designed so that everybody was supposed to have their own website, at its own  address. Of course, things got complicated early on. If you just wanted to  share some ideas, or talk to your friends, or do your work, managing all that  hassle became too much trouble, and pretty soon a big, expensive industry of  web consultants sprung up to handle the needs of anybody who still actually  wanted their own website—and had the money to pay for it.</p>
    <p><b>View  Source</b></p>
    <p>For the  first few years of the web, the fundamental way that people learned to build  web pages was by using the &quot;View Source&quot; feature in their web browser. You  would point your mouse at a menu that said something like &quot;View Source&quot; and  suddenly you&rsquo;d see the HTML code that made up the page you were looking at. It  was one of the most effective technology teaching tools ever created. And no  surprise, since the web was invented for the purpose of sharing knowledge.</p>
    <p> These days,  View Source is in bad shape. Most mobile devices don&rsquo;t support the feature at  all. And even on the desktop, the feature gets buried away, or hidden unless  you enable special developer settings. It&rsquo;s especially egregious because the  tools for working with HTML in a browser are better than ever. Bringing View  Source back could empower a new generation of creators to see the web as  something they make, not just a place where big companies put up sites that we  all dump our personal data into.<br>

    <blockquote>
      <p> Most complicated web pages these days aren’t  actually written by anyone. They’re assembled, by little programs that take the  instructions made by a coder, and then translate those instructions into the  actual HTML (and CSS, and JavaScript, and images, and everything else) that goes  to your browser.<br>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Authoring</b></p>
    <p>There are  all kinds of &quot;site building&quot; tools that let you pick a template and publish. Professionals  have authoring tools or content management systems for maintaining big, serious  websites. But these days, there are very few tools you could just use on your  computer (or your tablet, or your phone) to create a web page or web site from  scratch. </p>
    <p>In some  ways, billions of people make things on the web all the time. Only they don&rsquo;t  know they&rsquo;re making HTML, because Facebook (or Instagram, or whatever other app  they&rsquo;re using) generates it for them.<br>

  <p>Não se diz, mas dizemos: os artistas no papel ainda não conseguiram  a ponte à prática mas muitos já tentam. Hoje no <b>TCJ</b> recordam os prémios do <b>CCS</b> -não confundir com CSS- deste ano, nas suas duas categorias:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Best Print Comic:</b>  Keren Katz for &quot;The Academic Hour&quot; <br>
      <b>Best Web Comic:</b>  Michael DeForge for &quot;Leaving Richard’s Valley&quot;<br>

  <p>Repetimos: contra as penúrias nacionais, lá fora o digital faz o seu percurso, e o <em><b>The Center for Cartoon Studies</b></em> -que <a href="https://www.ospositivos.com/2016/10/comics-no-digital-os-media-webcomics.html">resume bastante pragmaticamente</a> as nossas teses- premeia <em>best print</em> <b>&</b> <em>best web</em>.

  <p><em>Hélas</em>, nem tudo são pérolas. Da sofisticação das propostas não nos pronunciamos, mas adiantamos que parte destes <i>webcomics</i> são ainda vítimas de um complexo de inferioridade ao <i>print</i> e onde quebram o molde não o fazem necessariamente para melhor.

      <p> I'm  interested in the accidental nature of drawing. I believe the accidents and  mistakes resulting from the act of drawing were the mysterious thing that was  giving life to those new drawings. And the most fascinating thing about it was  that they were not trying to cover up their accidents or correct their  mistakes, they were embodying and pursuing them.<br>
