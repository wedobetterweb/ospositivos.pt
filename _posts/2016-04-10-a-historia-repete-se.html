<h3>The Next War</h3>
<p>The long war had ended.<br>
  Its miseries had grown faded.<br>
  Deaf men became difficult to talk to,<br>
  Heroes became bores.<br>
  Those alchemists<br>
  Who had converted blood into gold<br>
  Had grown elderly.<br>
  But they held a meeting,<br>
  Saying,<br>
  'We think perhaps we ought<br>
  To put up tombs<br>
  Or erect altars<br>
  To those brave lads<br>
  Who were so willingly burnt,<br>
  Or blinded,<br>
  Or maimed,<br>
  Who lost all likeness to a living thing,<br>
  Or were blown to bleeding patches of flesh<br>
  For our sakes.<br>
  It would look well.<br>
  Or we might even educate the children.'<br>
  But the richest of these wizards<br>
  Coughed gently;<br>
  And he said: </p>
<p> 'I have always been to the front<br>
  -In private enterprise-,<br>
  I yield in public spirit<br>
  To no man.<br>
  I think yours is a very good idea<br>
  -A capital idea-<br>
  And not too costly . . .<br>
  But it seems to me<br>
  That the cause for which we fought<br>
  Is again endangered.<br>
  <strong>What more fitting memorial for the fallen<br>
  Than that their children<br>
  Should fall for the same cause?'</strong></p>
<p> Rushing eagerly into the street,<br>
  The kindly old gentlemen cried<br>
  To the young:<br>
  'Will you sacrifice<br>
  Through your lethargy<br>
  What your fathers died to gain ?<br>
  The world must be made safe for the young!'<br>
  And the children<br>
  Went. . . .</p>
