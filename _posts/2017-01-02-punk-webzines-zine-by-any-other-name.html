  <p>'zines e  punk, <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/01/us-them-punx.html">continuando de ontem</a>, e porque voltaremos aqui posteriormente, registo  para base de trabalho e estado da arte, onde assumimos as mesmas conclusões: é-nos muito muito interessante que os zines que reclamam ainda o termo e o look são os que menos têm a dizer.</p>
  <blockquote> ...within  literature on the internet, its potential as a democratic space, and the role  of web sites and blogs as exemplars of DIY communications culture, it would be easy&nbsp;to assume that the practices  and associations of the printed fanzine have more&nbsp;recently simply migrated  online. By evaluating the continuities and discontinuities&nbsp;between  the two moments of fanzine production, and the degree to which they&nbsp;articulate  the ideology and identities of anarcho-punks, we argue that more often  it&nbsp;is the symbolism and visual rhetoric of earlier print fanzines that  predominates.&nbsp;While many internet  advocates saw the early world-wide-web as a space for the&nbsp;sort of decentred  political and cultural activism that had characterised 1980s&nbsp;anarcho-punk,  there is little evidence that online fanzines continue to organise  and&nbsp;order an engaged music culture. (...)&nbsp;even a cursory  investigation shows that the issues of identity, ideology, defiance and  opposition are widespread on online message boards, blogs and in social media<span class="voice"> [sem necessidade de]</span> uses visual design, or a major emphasis on using  terms like fanzine or &lsquo;zine. The internet presents a wholly different set of potential  communicative and practices, the cultural work it demands is very different,  and it does not demand that its DIY status is signalled so strongly in its  visual form.<br>

  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> We  should recognise that in (…) these cases this online activity tries to align  recent cultural or commercial work with the subcultural capital of &lsquo;fan-eds&rsquo;  and the oppositional ideologies that have been historically associated with  fanzines in popular culture.</div>
  <p>Desenvolvendo,  destaques nossos, retalhos para efeito de leitura também.  A transição  / continuidade faz-se no visual, não no conteúdo, este descola-se da designação e transforma-se em algo de diferente mais adaptado ao meio. Novas tecnologias, outras  formas, desacoplamento do termo &quot;fanzine&quot; para outros modelos fragmentados -ex: Facebook e Twitter- não tão facilmente reconhecidos como a unidade de uma revista permite.</p>

  <p class="centre">Da  aparente simplicidade da transição e da sua realidade</p>
  <blockquote> Commentators  and academics alike have often pointed to the potential of the internet to  offer a communication and cultural space that greatly expands the sorts of  &lsquo;alternative critical space&rsquo;, &lsquo;crucial mechanism for interaction between  readers&rsquo;, and &lsquo;unifying vehicle for establishing and reinforcing shared values,  philosophy and opinions&rsquo; that is seen to characterise punk fanzines. Given  these arguments, it is not fanciful to suggest that we could see the punk  fanzines of the 1970s and 1980s as prototypes for the cultural interactions  that would take place in virtual space [and] it would be easy to assume that  the practices and meanings associated with the earlier printed fanzine have  simply migrated online.&nbsp;However, (...) &nbsp;while there is evidence of an  obvious attempt to reproduce the iconography of the print punk &lsquo;zines in online  sites, <b>this is most often a superficial act of iconic signification</b>, and <b>there is a more diverse and complex range of practices and products</b> than  found in earlier print incarnations of the fanzine phenomenon.<br>

  <h3 class="centre">II</h3>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> One could  speculate that they made significant use of the term fanzine and iconic  reference to the print &lsquo;zine&rsquo; status as a promotional tool. There were  certainly none of the discursive repertoires of punk identity, ideology,  defiance and opposition that were prominent in print publications.</div>
  <p class="centre">Do uso do  termo &quot;fanzine&quot;</p>
  <blockquote> The term  fanzine and fanzine iconography is widely used in, or associated with, websites  or blogs that do not have the same production practices or cultural role as the  earlier print fanzines. Most often this deployment of the term fanzine, or the  use of fanzine iconography, is <b>part of a mainly marketing or commercial aim</b>.  In some cases the web presence is there to support and sell as print-based  fanzine, but more often it is used to market other forms of product associated  with punk. These include recordings and other forms of merchandising.<br>

  <p class="centre">Da nova  realidade</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>There is a  considerable amount of online activity which was formally hosted within the  printed pages of punk &lsquo;zines, but which is less often listed against an online  search for punk fanzines</b>. This would include the editorial enthusiasm for certain bands,  participant reviews or exchanges about a shared musical interest, or <b>editorial  positions on a whole range of which are explicitly linked to anarcho-punk  philosophy</b>. We would suggest that it <b>is this activity which most closely  matches the cultural practices and products of punk &lsquo;zines, but it usually  takes place without any reference to terms like fanzines or webzines, and  without the deployment of any of the iconography of the 1970s and 80s print  fanzines</b>.<br>

  <h3 class="centre">IV</h3>
  <p class="centre"> Da  fragmentação&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote> Our  observations are only built upon <b>web platforms that most closely reproduce  the idea of a fanzine publication: the web site or blog</b>. There are, at  first sight, even more <b>Facebook</b> pages linked to the term &lsquo;punk fanzine&rsquo;,  and other social media platforms like <b>Twitter</b> contains an even greater  range of fan activity around the contemporary punk and anarcho-punk music  scenes.<br>

  <h3 class="centre">V</h3>
  <p class="centre">Da afirmação</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Overall, while many web sites or blogs may include visual references to  fanzines, and may even use the term in their titles or primary banners, they do not include the sorts of editorial  organisation,<b> the cultural practices or the discursive constructions of  identity and opposition</b> which characterised print fanzines. It is notable that many of these cultural  practices and discursive constructions are immediately apparent in <b>other  online activity around punk, and around political activism associated with  anarchopunk</b>.<br>

  <h3 class="centre">VI </h3>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> The  iconography of the late 1970s and early 1980s print fanzine: graffiti writing,  &lsquo;ransom note&rsquo; stylisation, used montage techniques, and typewriter and  stencil-styled typefaces, dot matrix&nbsp;printer</div>
  <p>E a  recordar os nossos <em>artys</em> de sa foderem ao largo quando intencionalmente entram em  modo retrogrado unicamente pela estética e não pelos constrangimentos técnicos  que limitavam a necessidade imperativa de fazer, tal como hoje escolhem fazer <em>zines  like it's 1999</em> a fingir de 1979.</p>
  <blockquote> It is not in  their iconography and symbolism that the print fanzines were relevant and  meaningful. Their visual design was an epiphenomenon of the discursive  practices of the &lsquo;fan editors&rsquo; who produced the fanzines in a manner which  indexed their DIY nature and the investment of effort of the editors as agents.  It is the low-tech cut-andpaste production of fanzines, the passion and effort  involved in producing fanzines, which gave them their essence of authenticity.  In particular this DIY practice is central to the ethos of anarcho-punk. The  print publications also needed further effort in the physical act of selling  and distributing fanzines at punk gigs, the face-to-face interaction that holds  cultural value amongst punk&rsquo;s subcultural groups. <b>One could speculate that  perhaps there is a resistance amongst anarchopunk and punk &lsquo;zine producers to  use the web as an alternative to the traditional physical form of the fanzine,  perhaps because the cultural work involved does not provide the same sort of  construction of </b><strong>authenticity</strong> <sup>(*)</sup><br>

  <p class="centre">Conclusão </p>
  <p>Cai o <em>&quot;fanzine&quot;</em>, surgem  novas formas, ficam as mesmas <em>&quot;filosofias&quot;</em>, <em>&quot;práticas culturais&quot;</em>,&nbsp;<em>&quot;posições editoriais&quot;</em>,<em> &quot;construções discursivas de identidade&quot;</em>. Ou, aquilo d<b>OS POSITIVOS.</b>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Da  abundância do punk no Twitter e Facebook versus o blog: equiparamos Twitter à  rádio, Facebook a televisão e blog à revista impressa. Os punx okupam as <em>airwaves</em> agora, mas são canais por subscrição e é preciso trazê-los de volta ao sinal aberto.</p>
