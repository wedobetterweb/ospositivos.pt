    10 nov 2017</sup></h1>
  <div>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve had a few similar conversations lately with colleagues I   admire in the Web industry. They&rsquo;ve all mentioned that they are a bit   tired and burnt out. This happens, especially over time. But there is a   trend. For most it comes down to the fact that the etherial World Wide   Web, <strong>The Medium that we all love, appears broken or unrepairable.</strong></p>
    <p>The Medium which tied the world together is being used and exploited to drive us apart. Social networks promote abuse. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/11/05/562058208/how-russia-weaponized-social-media-with-social-bots">Our data and personal information are weaponized against us</a>.   Chatbots competitively one-up eachother over conspiracy theories,   gathering data. The endless daily news cycle of multiple things to be   outraged about is exhausting for most non-robots. In many ways the   central question of &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; has changed to &ldquo;What are we mad   about?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s hard to divorce the The Medium from the problems of the Physical   World. Death. Struggle. Injustice. Politics. This sustained level of   IRL civic engagement is tiring, but I will keep my eyes on the prize,   hold on.</p>
    <p>Alas, even the etherial currency created for The Medium is now working to destroy Physical World. <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ywbbpm/bitcoin-mining-electricity-consumption-ethereum-energy-climate-change">One Bitcoin transaction now uses as much energy as your house in a week</a>. If it were me, I&rsquo;d shut down this experiment. It is immoral.</p>
    <p>But that&rsquo;s part of the problem, isn&rsquo;t it? We&rsquo;re building things   without regard for the ethical implications. Especially, if ignoring the   ethical ramificiations happens to create wealth. <strong>&ldquo;Peak capitalism&rdquo;</strong> I   guess it&rsquo;s called. As we yield control over to artificial intelligence   and learned machines, I can only hope their trainers considered more   than efficiency and capitalism.</p>
    <p><a href="https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html">The Medium is slowly being owned by a handful of companies</a>. Reports of the Web&rsquo;s death are greatly exaggerated, but concentrations of power rarely end up well for the general public.</p>
    <p>For the physical pixels and bytes delivered to the glowing screens, I have heard specific concerns as well.</p>
    <p>Recently in a talk about design I heard that &ldquo;UX is a solved   problem.&rdquo; This particular use of &ldquo;UX&rdquo; was in the context of GUIs. That&rsquo;s   a bit deflating and hard to rebut. But maybe in some ways this is a   relief, in less than 20 years we&rsquo;ve managed to upload enough wisdom and   shared knowledge into The Medium, that problems are no longer problems.   Our knowledge can be automated and we can start thinking about bigger   problems.</p>
    <p>As browsers have gotten better and eliminated age-old problems, the   build tools have gotten more complicated. In a recent talk on Source   Maps I heard that &ldquo;JavaScript is a compiled language&rdquo;, which is to say   the output sent to the browser more resembles a binary format than its   human readable source. This is true, though not required. For me, I feel   the complex toolchain disconnecting me from the instant gratification   of publishing to the Web.</p>
    <p><strong>Lord, save me from my Ludditism.</strong></p>
    <p>I share the disillusionment. This version of The Medium is not The   Medium I want or fell in love with. This is a love story about humans   connecting across continents. I want to be hopeful even at the risk of   being naïve.</p>
    <p>I have to keep reminding myself that <strong>I do have some control.</strong> <strong>I can   build The Medium I want.</strong> <strong>I can cling to what&rsquo;s good.</strong> And this gives me   hope.</p>

<p>Temos que nos manter <b>P+</b>. E para o ser, retomemos do excerto acima: <em>&quot;I do have somne control&quot;,</em> é uma questão de o exercer para termos a <em>web</em> que queremos.

<blockquote>
<ul class="lista">
  <li>By social media I mean Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, et al. Content is fast, abundant, easy. Ephemeral.</li>
  <li>By blogs I mean recurrent long(er) form writing published under an individual’s fixed identity so you can get a sense of their commitment to (and understanding of) the ideas. Lots of people do this on Medium these days, although independent blogs (such as this one) still exist.</li>
  <li>By periodicals I mean magazines, journals, and other venues for recurrent publishing under a branded (group) identity. They have more skin in the game than bloggers, and this gives them more credibility. Think of The New Yorker, The Economist, and Slate.</li>
  <li>You know what books are. I’m partial to the ones still in active circulation 20+ years after they were first published; that’s the market’s way of filtering out the chaff.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Agora definidos, como se processam.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <ul class="lista">
  <li>The layers move (and change) slower as you go down the stack;<br>
    </li>
  <li>The top layers are where we experiment with new ideas;<br>
    </li>
  <li>The bottom layers are where the worthwhile ones are reified;<br>
    </li>
  <li>Worthwhile ideas make their way down to the the lower layers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Obviamente, a importância tende aos livros -</p>

    <p>If you’re looking to build your character, the best texts are the ones at the very bottom. Much of the stuff in the top layers is only good for raising your heart rate.<br>
