Segue-nos: The mafia of the internet: the ISPs As much as we may think of the internet as a placeless realm of pure abstractions, it has a physical structure. It&rsquo;s not magic. And more people are waking up to this reality each day. The internet is a series of copper and fiber optic cables that burrow through the ground and tunnel under oceans. We call this the Internet Backbone. The internet is then further distributed through regional backbones. Despite the involvement of huge telecoms, the internet backbone represents a fairly healthy market. About 40% of the internet&rsquo;s backbone is controlled by smaller networks you&rsquo;ve never heard of. The broadband internet market, on the other hand, isn&rsquo;t healthy at all. This is the &quot;last mile&quot; of cables that plug into the internet backbone. And it&rsquo;s full of ugly tollbooths, guarded by thick benches of lawyers and lobbyists. These ISPs control millions of miles of copper cables that they buried in the ground and satellites they shot up into orbit. They constantly break the law, tie up regulators in lengthy court battles, and make it practically impossible for anyone - even Google - to enter their markets.

They chose Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg may mean well, but he&rsquo;s rapidly destroying the open internet. in &quot;The future of the open internet - and our way of life - is in your hands&quot; 16 mar 2017 * Ah, aquilo da benevolência: Internet.org is a partnership between social networking services company Facebook and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries. It has been criticized for violating net neutrality, and by handpicking internet services that are included, for discriminating against companies not in the list, including Facebook&#39;s rivals. in Wikipedia 23 mar 2017 Voltando à net neutrality: The story of ISPs basically comes down to this: They used to make a ton of money off of cable packages. But people discovered that once they had the internet, they didn&rsquo;t care about cable TV any more - they just wanted data plans and so they could watch YouTube, Netflix, or whatever shows they wanted. The ISPs don&rsquo;t make nearly as much selling you a data plan as they used to make selling you a cable plan, though. So their goal is to return to the &quot;good old days&quot; by locking down the internet into &quot;channels&quot; and &quot;bundles&quot; then forcing you to buy those. How do we prevent this? The good news is that we already have. In 2015, the FCC passed a law that regulated ISPs as utilities. This is based on the principle of &quot;Net Neutrality&quot; which basically states that all information passing through a network should be treated equally. The FCC&rsquo;s Title II regulation created three &quot;bright lines&quot; that prevent ISPs from doing the following: 1. Blocking content from websites 2. Slowing down content from websites 3. Accepting money from websites to speed up their content These rules made it so that no matter how rich and powerful a corporation is - and Apple and Google are the biggest corporations on Earth, and Microsoft and Facebook aren&rsquo;t far behind - they can&rsquo;t buy priority access to the internet. Everyone has to compete on a level playing field. These tech conglomerates have to compete with the scrappy startups, the mom-and-pop businesses, and even independent bloggers who are running WordPress on their own domain. It&rsquo;s as simple a tool as possible for protecting the capitalist free market internet from monopolies who would otherwise abuse their power. The reason ISPs want to get rid of Net Neutrality is simple: if we stop treating them like the utility that they are, they can find ways to charge a lot more money. ISPs see an opportunity to double dip. They want to charge for bandwidth, and also charge websites what the Mafia calls &quot;protection money.&quot; They essentially want to be able to say to website owners: &quot;Those are some lovely data packets you&rsquo;ve got there. It sure would be a shame if they got lost on their way to your users.&quot; in &quot;The future of the open internet - and our way of life - is in your hands&quot; 16 mar 2017 O que nos trás de volta à open web e à atenção que todos precisam -funny?

Mark Zuckerberg may mean well, but he&rsquo;s rapidly destroying the open internet. in &quot;The future of the open internet - and our way of life - is in your hands&quot; 16 mar 2017 * Ah, aquilo da benevolência: Internet.org is a partnership between social networking services company Facebook and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries. It has been criticized for violating net neutrality, and by handpicking internet services that are included, for discriminating against companies not in the list, including Facebook&#39;s rivals. in Wikipedia 23 mar 2017 Voltando à net neutrality: The story of ISPs basically comes down to this: They used to make a ton of money off of cable packages. But people discovered that once they had the internet, they didn&rsquo;t care about cable TV any more - they just wanted data plans and so they could watch YouTube, Netflix, or whatever shows they wanted. The ISPs don&rsquo;t make nearly as much selling you a data plan as they used to make selling you a cable plan, though. So their goal is to return to the &quot;good old days&quot; by locking down the internet into &quot;channels&quot; and &quot;bundles&quot; then forcing you to buy those. How do we prevent this? The good news is that we already have. In 2015, the FCC passed a law that regulated ISPs as utilities. This is based on the principle of &quot;Net Neutrality&quot; which basically states that all information passing through a network should be treated equally. The FCC&rsquo;s Title II regulation created three &quot;bright lines&quot; that prevent ISPs from doing the following: 1. Blocking content from websites 2. Slowing down content from websites 3. Accepting money from websites to speed up their content These rules made it so that no matter how rich and powerful a corporation is - and Apple and Google are the biggest corporations on Earth, and Microsoft and Facebook aren&rsquo;t far behind - they can&rsquo;t buy priority access to the internet. Everyone has to compete on a level playing field. These tech conglomerates have to compete with the scrappy startups, the mom-and-pop businesses, and even independent bloggers who are running WordPress on their own domain. It&rsquo;s as simple a tool as possible for protecting the capitalist free market internet from monopolies who would otherwise abuse their power. The reason ISPs want to get rid of Net Neutrality is simple: if we stop treating them like the utility that they are, they can find ways to charge a lot more money. ISPs see an opportunity to double dip. They want to charge for bandwidth, and also charge websites what the Mafia calls &quot;protection money.&quot; They essentially want to be able to say to website owners: &quot;Those are some lovely data packets you&rsquo;ve got there. It sure would be a shame if they got lost on their way to your users.&quot; in &quot;The future of the open internet - and our way of life - is in your hands&quot; 16 mar 2017 O que nos trás de volta à open web e à atenção que todos precisam -funny?

  <blockquote> As much as we may think of the internet as a placeless realm of pure abstractions, it has a physical structure. It&rsquo;s not magic. And more people are waking up to this reality each day.<br>
    <br>    
  The internet is a series of copper and fiber optic cables that burrow through the ground and tunnel under oceans. We call this the Internet Backbone. The internet is then further distributed through regional backbones. Despite the involvement of huge telecoms, the internet backbone represents a fairly healthy market. About 40% of the internet&rsquo;s backbone is controlled by smaller networks you&rsquo;ve never heard of.    The broadband internet market, on the other hand, isn&rsquo;t healthy at all. This is the &quot;last mile&quot; of cables that plug into the internet backbone. And it&rsquo;s full of ugly tollbooths, guarded by thick benches of lawyers and lobbyists. <br>
  <br>
  These ISPs control millions of miles of copper cables that they buried in the ground and satellites they shot up into orbit. They constantly break the law, tie up regulators in lengthy court battles, and make it practically impossible for anyone - even Google - to enter their markets.  </blockquote>
