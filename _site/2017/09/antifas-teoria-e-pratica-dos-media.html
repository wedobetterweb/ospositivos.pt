<p>Pois. Enterrado no final do artigo. Tal como esta pérola: depois de todo o alarme, a verdade é que os próprios admitem que não sabem do que falam:</p>
<div class="blurb"><i class="bublle"></i> &quot;There’s a lot more we don’t know about these groups than what we do know about them.&quot;</div>
<blockquote>
  <p>The agency also acknowledged gaps in its understanding of antifa, saying<b> it had only &quot;medium confidence&quot; in its assessments</b> regarding both the affiliations among the various groups and the motivation of attackers.<br>

<p> Ora, o problema desta narrativa deverá ser óbvio. E, como típica peça que lança uma ideia bombástica no título para ao longo do seu corpo denotar o contrário apenas àqueles que lerem o artigo com atenção, o próprio compreende a amplitude da sua imbecilidade:</p>
<div class="info coluna">
<blockquote>
  <p>Those reports appear to<b> bolster Trump’s insistence that extremists on the left bore some blame </b>for the clashes in Charlottesville and represent a &quot;problem&quot; nationally.<br>

</div>
<p>E dá-lhe argumentos:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>These antifa guys were showing up with weapons, shields and bike helmets and just beating the shit out of people. … They’re using Molotov cocktails, they’re starting fires, they’re throwing bombs and smashing windows. Almost immediately, the right-wing targets of the antifa attacks began fighting back, bringing more and larger weapons and launching unprovoked attacks of their own, the documents and interviews show. Even before Charlottesville, dozens and, in some cases, hundreds of people on both sides showed up at events in Texas, California, Oregon and elsewhere, carrying weapons and looking for a fight. Both the racists and a segment of violent antifa counter-protestors are amped for battle in an escalating arms race, resulting in increasingly violent dangerous confrontations.<br>

<p>...mas, Trumpas, <em>remember</em>?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In interviews, law enforcement authorities made clear that Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric and policies - first as a candidate and then as president - helped to create a situation that has escalated so quickly and extensively that they do not have a handle on it.<b> &quot;It was in that period [as the Trump campaign emerged] that we really became aware of them&quot;</b>.<br>

<p>Extra, duas pérolas a notar dessa mesma peça. Primeiro, ignoram a   longa história de perseguição feita aos &quot;eco-terroristas&quot;, uma tão rica que até há sufixo próprio.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In recent decades, authorities have focused almost exclusively on right-wing groups as the most likely instigators of domestic terrorist violence, especially since Timothy McVeigh blew up the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, killing 168 people.<br>

<p>Pérola dois, a marca pontos pelo profissionalismo.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>At the Sacramento rally, antifa protesters came looking for violence, and &quot;engaged in several activities indicating proficiency in pre-operational planning, to include organizing carpools to travel from different locations, raising bail money in preparation for arrests, counter-surveilling law enforcement using three-man scout teams, using handheld radios for communication, and coordinating the event via social media,&quot; the DHS report said.<br>

<p>Menos mal.</p>
