<p>Muito sobre <b>comunidade</b> com ênfase no <b>real</b>, e este com ênfase no <b>local</b>. Familiar? A receita para a oposição  ao <em>Big Brother</em> <b>digital</b> que já <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2016/11/o-local.html">aqui assinalámos.</a> Mas no ano de todas as  transformações, enquanto outros acordam para a necessidade de resistir em  digital, os <em>powers that be</em> fazem o  percurso em sentido inverso e apontam canhões à vida real. E tal como a  estratégia de resistência implica a apropriação do digital, a estratégia de invasão  implica a subtração e distorção das nossas bases. A solução sempre a soubemos: <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/01/apropriacao.html">distribuição,  distribuída</a>. E é nessa frente que, aparentemente, o Facebook começará o seu  assalto.</p>
<p>Este sugere no  seu manifesto que tentará a transposição do digital para o real posicionando-se  enquanto uma plataforma cívica/política, o salto mais ambicioso que alguma  corporação -tech-media ou outra- poderia querer fazer, com desafios impossíveis  de prever porque nunca antes tentados, muito menos a esta escala. Imaginamos os  políticos a resistir a esta incursão na igual medida que o FB seja bem-sucedido  nesse processo com o foi em destruir os media. E tal como os jornalistas, também  os políticos assistirão impotentes ao estabelecimento da nova ordem mundial  quando, como nos media, se aperceberem demasiado tarde das implicações e magnitude  do agora proposto.</p>

<p>Passemos a palavra -</p>
<blockquote> <b>Mark Zuckerberg says change the world, yet he sets the rules</b>  <br>
  <br>
  Last week Mark Zuckerberg set  out a new mission for the company he has created. (...) A role that might be  more accurately described as this: <b>government</b>.   Because that&rsquo;s what this letter is, a  template for<b> Facebook&rsquo;s role in a new  world order</b>. A supranational power that exists above and beyond the nation  state. A digital interface between you and everything else: your friends, the  news, the world.<br>

<div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i>
  And I do think it&rsquo;s disingenuous in that Zuckerberg&rsquo;s post is not  mentioning any of this. </div>
<blockquote> In last week&rsquo;s wordy essay in  which Zuckerberg generally tries to promote the grandiose notion that  Facebook&rsquo;s future role is to be the glue holding the fabric of global society  together, (...) he fails to flag the obvious paradox: that technology which  helps amplify misinformation and prejudice might not be so great for social  cohesion after all.<br>
  <br>
  Make no mistake, this is a  huge shift from the one-size fits all &lsquo;community standards&rsquo; Facebook has  peddled for years. (...)&nbsp;The problem is this — and indeed much else in the  ~5,000-word post — <b>is mostly  misdirection</b>.<br>

<div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> 
  We haven&rsquo;t even started to think about what that means. </div>
<blockquote>Zuckerberg&rsquo;s wrestling with  the question of how Facebook can change the world. Whereas the question is: do we  actually want Facebook to change the world? Do we want any corporation to have  so much unchecked power? Facebook is not just any corporation<b>. It is a surveillance machine.</b> Researchers from Cambridge University showed that knowing just 10 &quot;likes&quot; a  Facebook user had clicked gave you more information on someone than a colleague  might know; 150 and you&rsquo;d know more than their partner. With 300, you&rsquo;d know  more about them than they knew about themselves.<small><br>

  Try this for a thought  experiment. Pretend Mark Zuckerberg wasn&rsquo;t born in White Plains, New York.  Pretend, instead, he was born in Smolensk, Russia. His Facebook is not  headquartered in Menlo Park, Silicon Valley. Instead, its global nerve centre  is in Moscow. And he isn&rsquo;t a freckled, fresh-faced young man with a  nice-looking family and a cute dog. This Zuckerberg likes hunting, poses with  guns and owns a bull mastiff.<br>
  <br>
  What do you think of this less  cuddly Mark Zuckerberg? This Facebook? The company that in its last quarter  earned $8.8bn and counts half of the world&rsquo;s internet users – 1.86 billion  people – as its customers. The company that harvests your data, owns your baby  photos, controls your news feed and goes to ever further lengths to capture  your attention. What do you make of this Zuckerberg – let&rsquo;s call him Misha –  and his 5,000-word letter to the world, published on Thursday?<br>
  <br>
  Facebook is a corporation doing  what corporations do: making money, grabbing market share, maximizing profit.  Think of Russian Mark Zuckerberg _ Misha, as I think of him – plotting all this  from his headquarters in a business park outside Moscow, a bull mastiff at his  side, his relationship to Putin still to play out. Still want that? Da?<br>

  Though he  never uses the word &quot;nationalism,&quot; that's clearly what's on his mind. </div>
<blockquote> Zuckerberg positions <b>Facebook as a force for political change</b> in the coming years. (...) He adds that we need social media to &quot;reach the  next level.&quot; That next level is some kind of ill-defined global community  which will come into being by using Facebook as a platform.&nbsp;Zuckerberg  adds that he's thinking of creating &quot;worldwide voting system&quot; for  Facebook users which could then be used as a template for how &quot;collective  decision-making may work in other aspects of the global community.&quot; He  sounds like he's floating the idea of turning Facebook into the infrastructure  for managing elections.<br>

  <p>The company's next big push is  for communities with local, real-world impact <span class="voice">[with]</span> &quot;meaningful  groups&quot;, defined as &quot;the core of your social network experience and  physical support structure.&quot; The main way these groups will be different  from a regular community is that they are explicitly designed to bring people  together offline, IRL, in the physical world, (...) it's embedded in our  offline lives. They are, in other words, connected to <b>local geographical  areas.</b></p>
  <p>Facebook is going to start  surfacing these groups to users a lot, in an effort to get more people to join  them. Unlike other groups on Facebook, meaningful groups will be <b>centered  around leaders.</b> He asserted, &quot;The best communities in the world have  leaders.&quot;</p>
  <p>Meaningful groups sound like  they would be ideal for politicians trying to garner a local following. As a  leader, you'll have access to tools that will grow your group. And why wouldn't  you do that? After all, Zuckerberg has said that politicians with the biggest  Facebook engagement always win elections.<br>

    From an  anarchist perspective, organizational structure should maximize both freedom  and voluntary coordination at every level of scale, from the smallest group up  to society as a whole.<br>
    <br>
    An affinity  group is a circle of friends who understand themselves as an autonomous political  force. The idea is that people who already know and trust each other should  work together to respond immediately, intelligently, and flexibly to emerging  situations.<br>

    This  leaderless format has proven effective for guerrilla activities of all kinds,  in which many unpredictable autonomous groups overwhelm a centralized  adversary.<small><br>

<p>Voltando à Singularidade, o <em>deep learning</em> alimenta-se de quantidades massivas de dados. A  aquisição desses dados obrigam a uma ginástica imensa de técnicas e  tecnologias. Mas, melhor mesmo, só pondo os próprios utilizadores a carregar os  seus dados.</p>

<p>O que levanta a questão: </p>
<blockquote> Given the scale of Facebook&rsquo;s tracking systems and machine learning  algorithms, couldn&rsquo;t it essentially infer individuals&rsquo; likely tolerance for  controversial content? Why does it need to ask at all?<br>

<p>Duas respostas possíveis: </p>
<blockquote>   It is more total information management. The more they can get, and  the more granular those personal controls get the more information they&rsquo;re  picking up. (...)&nbsp;Not only could they derive that information from what  they already have but it would also help them to fine-tune the information they  already have. It works in two directions. It reinforces the profiling, and  could be deduced from profiling in the first place: It&rsquo;s checking their  inferred data is accurate (...) It&rsquo;s almost testing their algorithms. <b>It can  actually, effectively be improving their ability to determine information on  people.</b><br>
  <br>
  There could be a difference, in data protection law terms. If we&rsquo;ve  given it consensually then it&rsquo;s clearer that they have permission. &amp; shifting  some of the responsibility for the types of content being shown onto users  implicitly shifts some of the blame away from Facebook when controversies  inexorably arise. So, basically: see something you don&rsquo;t like in your News Feed  in future? Well, that&rsquo;s YOUR fault now! Either you didn&rsquo;t set your Facebook  content settings correctly. Or you didn&rsquo;t set any at all… Tsk!<br>

<p>E uma conclusão - óbvia, mas já o era há tanto tempo atrás que não nos mata repetir...: </p>
<blockquote>   This is increasing risks and  increasing our vulnerability at a time when we should be doing exactly the  opposite: given the level at which they&rsquo;re profiling we shouldn&rsquo;t tell them  anymore.<br>

<p>AKA e repetimos, <em>the filter bubble issue.</em></p>
<blockquote> Zuckerberg&rsquo;s blog post has a  fair amount of fuzzy thinking on filter bubbles, as you might expect from the  chief of an engagement-algorithm-driven content distribution machine. But - for  all his talk of &quot;building global community&quot; - he offers no clear fix for how  Facebook can help break users out of the AI-enabled, navel-gazing circles <b>its business model</b> creates.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="voice">[The]</span> risk that giving users  controls over controversial content could exacerbate the filter bubble effect  further - a user who can effectively dial down all controversy to zero: It&rsquo;s  going to be a lot easier for them to live inside a padded Facebook stream  populated with cute photos of babies and kittens. News? What news? Awwww, how  purdy!<br>
    <br>
    And while that might make a  pleasing experience for individuals who wants to disengage from wider global  realities, it&rsquo;s reductive for society as a whole if lots of people start  retreating into rose-tinted filter bubbles. (...) Giving people easy opt outs  for types of content that might push them outside their comfort zone and force  them to confront unfamiliar ideas or encounter a different or difficult  perspective just offers a self-enabled filter bubble.<br>
    <br>
    This issue is of rising  important given how many users Facebook has, and how the massively dominant  platform has been shown to be increasingly cannibalizing traditional news  media; becoming a place people go to get news generally, not just to learn what  their friends are up to.&nbsp;<br>

  Zuckerberg is building a news organization without journalists.</div>
<div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> 
  Zuckerberg doesn&rsquo;t want Facebook to kill journalism as we know it. He  really, really doesn&rsquo;t. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean he won&rsquo;t. </div>
<blockquote> It&rsquo;s not that Mark Zuckerberg  set out to dismantle the news business when he founded Facebook 13 years ago.  Yet news organizations are perhaps the biggest casualty of the world Zuckerberg  built. There&rsquo;s reason to believe things are going to get worse.<br>
  <br>
  A sprawling new manifesto by  Zuckerberg, published to Facebook on Thursday, should set off new alarm bells  for journalists, and heighten news organizations&rsquo; sense of urgency about how  they—and their industry—can survive in a Facebook-dominated world. Facebook&rsquo;s  existing threat to journalism is well established. It is, at its core, about  the flow of the advertising dollars that news organizations once counted on. In  this way, Facebook&rsquo;s role is a continuation of what began in 1995, when  Craigslist was founded. Its founder, Craig Newmark, didn&rsquo;t actively aim to decimate  newspapers, but Craigslist still eviscerated a crucial revenue stream for print  when people stopped buying newspaper classified ads.<br>

  The company is absolutely  dominating in the realm of digital advertising. (...) Now, Zuckerberg is making  it clear that he wants Facebook to take over many of the actual functions—not  just ad dollars—that traditional news organizations once had.<br>
  <br>
  Zuckerberg uses abstract  language in his memo (...) but what he&rsquo;s really describing is building a media  company with classic journalistic goals: The Facebook of the future, he writes,  will be &quot;for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for  inclusion of all.&quot;<br>

<p>E onde a <em>press</em> se preocupa como local, por boas razões.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The deaths of news  organizations have jeopardized the prospect of a safe, well-informed,  civically-engaged community. One 2014 paper found a substantial drop-off in  civic engagement (...) after cities saw the closure of longstanding daily  newspapers. The decline was &quot;not consistently replicated over the same time  period in other major American cities that did not lose a newspaper,&quot;  suggesting that the decline in civic engagement may be attributed to  disappearance of local news sources. If local media institutions are strong and  are binding individuals and groups together, then citizens should be  participating in more community groups, contacting their government more  frequently, and circulating more petitions because they are more aware of  shared problems, interests, and opportunities.<br>
    <br>
    Zuckerberg obviously  understands this. The problem is that Zuckerberg lays out concrete ideas about  how to build community on Facebook (...) in an assumption that news, which has  always been subsidized by the advertising dollars his company now commands,  will continue to feed into Facebook&rsquo;s system at little to no cost to Facebook.</p>
  Zuckerberg is building  a news organization without journalists. The uncomfortable truth for  journalists, though, is that Facebook is much better at community building in  the digital age than news organizations are.<br>
  <br>
  Zuckerberg is continuing to  push Facebook&rsquo;s hands-off approach to editorial responsibility. Facebook is  outsourcing its decision-making power about what&rsquo;s in your News Feed. Instead  of the way a newspaper editor decides what&rsquo;s on the front page, the user will  decide. &quot;For those who don&rsquo;t make a decision, the default will be whatever the  majority of people in your region selected, like a referendum&quot;. The most cynical way to  describe this set-up is to say that Facebook is asking its users to act as  unpaid publishers and curators of content (...) and now also to act as unpaid  editors, volunteering to teach Facebook&rsquo;s algorithmic editors how and when to  surface the content Facebook does not pay for. In other words, Facebook is  building a global newsroom run by robot editors and its own readers.<br>
  <br>
  This strategy may be right for  Facebook, which has a strong track record of predicting what its users want.  But if journalism is an indispensable component of the global community  Zuckerberg is trying to build, he must also realize that what he&rsquo;s building is  a grave threat to journalism.<br>
  <br>
  All of this is the news  industry&rsquo;s problem; not Zuckerberg&rsquo;s. But it&rsquo;s also a problem for anyone who  believes in and relies on quality journalism <b>to make sense of the world.</b><br>

<p>Regressando: se  no jornalismo provocou a queda dos media, pensemos da importância política do  FB no mundo! Ah, e já repararam como tudo devolve à &quot;classe média&quot; que nos ocupava no <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2017/02/ai-bot.html"><em>post</em> anterior</a>? </p>

<blockquote> On Friday, Zuckerberg wrote  &quot;the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social  infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works  for all of us&quot;. But there is something chilling in Zuckerberg&rsquo;s failure to recognize  that Facebook is already a for-profit form of social infrastructure, with  immense and unprecedented power over our lives. And in making its profit,  Facebook creates social value, yes, but also social harm. A quarter of the  world&rsquo;s population – 1.86 billion people – have Facebook accounts. Facebook  shapes the way they consume, process and interact with information, and with  each other.<br>
    <br>
    By filtering the information  we see, Facebook also changes the way we think. Its algorithms – whose design,  of course, is motivated by profit – function as editors, pushing us to content  that we are most likely to find engaging, from people we are naturally drawn  to.<br>
    <br>
    Like other corporate giants,  Facebook has done all in its power to minimize its tax bill, paying a fraction  of what it owes the societies from which it draws its profits, undermining the  very social infrastructure Zuckerberg claims to want to build. Yet Silicon  Valley entrepreneurs have the gall to argue that government should pay everyone  an unconditional basic income while one of its biggest darlings pays hardly any  tax. It forewarns of a feudal-type world where a select few own all the  technological wealth and pay the rest of us just enough to eke out a basic  subsistence.<br>

  <div class="info coluna">
  <blockquote> Facebook is the grim sign of  something going seriously wrong in our economic model. (...) Zuckerberg&rsquo;s pitch  is a warning to us all. If he really wanted to do good, he would be launching a  debate on how governments can regulate new-age natural monopolies such as  Facebook, and publishing Facebook&rsquo;s algorithms to make them as transparent as  newspaper editorial policies.<br>
      <br>
      Facebook&rsquo;s success is  prophetic of a future in which we may all have to rely on a few all-powerful  companies benevolently gifting us scraps like grants for struggling media organizations,  or a meagre basic income to supplement poverty wages. But today, consumers and  citizens still have the power to demand something different, and the laws of  our lands still have the power to enforce it. <b>We should act while we can.</b><br>

  <blockquote> Another glaring omission in  Zuckerberg&rsquo;s writing is the risk of Facebook&rsquo;s cache of highly personal (and  likely increasingly sensitive) data being misused by overreaching governments  seeking to clamp down on particular groups within society. (...) The threat  posed to Facebook users by government agencies appropriating accounts to enable  highly intrusive, warrantless searches - and presumably go on phishing  expeditions for incriminating content -&nbsp;(...) apparently does not merit  public consideration by Facebook&rsquo;s CEO.&nbsp;<b>Instead, Zuckerberg is calling  for more user data, and for increased use of Facebook.</b><br>
  <br>
  It&rsquo;s especially strange for a  US CEO to stay silent on this at this point in time, given how social media searches  by US customs agents have ramped up following President Trump&rsquo;s Executive Order  on immigration last month. There have also been suggestions that foreigners  wanting to enter the US could be forced to hand over their social media  passwords to US border agents in future. All of which has very clear and very  alarming implications for Facebook users and their Facebook data.<br>

<p>No tópico do rebanho <em>&amp; hell is other people</em>, novamente uma passagem a recordar aqueles de tradição mais libertária porque as massas não estão ainda emancipadas: em boa parte, porque não o querem, e todos sofremos.</p>
<blockquote> Users who do not want to share  any additional sensitive signals with the ad-targeting giant will be forced to  tolerate their peers&rsquo; predilections. (...)&nbsp;Which immediately puts pressure  on users to confess their content likes/dislikes to Facebook in order to avoid  this &lsquo;hell is other people&rsquo;s tastes&rsquo; bind. (...) So by not telling Facebook  anything about your content thresholds you&rsquo;re put into a default corner of  telling Facebook you&rsquo;re okay with whatever the regional average is okay with,  content wise. And that may be the opposite of okay for you.<br>
  <br>
  I think there&rsquo;s another little  trap here that they&rsquo;ve done before: when you make controls granular it looks as  if you&rsquo;re giving people control — but actually people generally get bored and  don&rsquo;t bother changing anything. So you can say you&rsquo;ve given people control, and  now it&rsquo;s all much better — but in general they don&rsquo;t use it.&nbsp;<br>

<blockquote> The idea that we concentrate  all our stuff in one place — both in one online place (i.e. Facebook) and one  physical place (i.e. our smartphones), puts us at greater risk when we have  governments who are likely to take advantage of those risks.

  <b>Anyone who&rsquo;s got any sense is  not going to be doing anything that&rsquo;s even slightly risky on Facebook and  should be looking for alternatives.</b> Because while the border  guards may know about Facebook and Twitter they&rsquo;re not going to know about the  more obscure systems, and they&rsquo;re not going to be able to get access to them. <b>So now is actually the time for us to be  saying let&rsquo;s do less Facebook, not more Facebook.</b><br>
