First, prior research on social movements and organizational responses to technological change has largely examined how and why incumbent firms eventually adopt practices or values that emerge from an outside social movement.

Second, scholars interested in incumbent responses to technological change have highlighted how collective identity can become a cognitive trap that can prevent; here again, this paper offers an alternative view that illustrates how collective identity can become a mechanism to enable incumbent resilience and adaptation in the wake of a technological discontinuity. Finally, research at the intersection of social movements and collective identity has examined how mobilization of normative and economic interests can constitute new market categories with distinct collective identities.

Curation: Independent booksellers began to focus on curating inventory that allowed them to provide a more personal and specialized customer experience. Rather than only recommending bestsellers, they developed personal relationships with customers by helping them discover up-and-coming authors and unexpected titles. Convening: Independent booksellers also started to promote their stores as intellectual centers for convening customers with likeminded interests—offering lectures, book signings, game nights, children&rsquo;s story times... even birthday parties. in &quot;The Value of Local Independent Bookstores&quot; 26 nov 2017 Mercado, elites, gigantes prepotentes e freaks locais.
