<blockquote>
When Berners-Lee created <strong>the web</strong>, <b>it was a decentralized platform</b>. <b>Anyone could publish a website and link to any other site</b>. But as the web has grown from an obscure research-sharing tool for the scientific community into a<b> global medium for commerce, communication, journalism, and entertainment</b>, <strong>the power dynamics have shifted</strong>. Today, huge companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Netflix dominate the web. These corporate giants enjoy an enormous amount of control not only over what people see and do online but over users’ private data. <br>
