  <p>Broadcast-focused, open social networks revolutionized the way we connect with people online. First-wave social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram ushered in a golden era of social media and allowed people to build audiences and have their voice heard by millions. But in 2017, the novelty of racking up a million followers has washed away. Tweeting out your opinions only to be shouted down by Nazis has caused many users to abandon posting on open social networks and instead spend more time in closed networks and group chats.</p>
  <p>As users migrate to these closed systems, they’re also shifting away from the type of broad-based algorithmic feeds packed with news and media content that were the hallmark of first-generation social media. This isn’t to say that people are consuming less media; they aren’t. However media consumption will become a more separate, intentional behavior. Publishers will have to find their footing and adopt new distribution strategies to take advantage of this shift in user behavior - roducing the type of premium content users will subscribe to and seek out. <b>It means spending less time trying to reach the widest audience on the web and more time building intentional, dedicated audiences.</b><br>

   <p>Challenges to the global status quo have prompted news media to get on top of its game — producing some of the strongest reporting we’ve seen from some quarters. But it has also lowered the threshold for what’s considered news. We’ve arrived at a pivot point in our history, and with that come the dueling cravings to be current on events while truly understanding their significance. <b>The first is easier to achieve: One can passively sit back and absorb news by reflexively checking one’s phone screen, for example. The second — obtaining true understanding — is trickier: Where can one turn not for the latest, but for the most meaningful answers?</b><br>
     <br>
     Following one of the most intense years of news coverage in recent memory, mixed with the ongoing tectonic shocks of technology, more news consumers will likely tire of the machine-gun salvo of incremental factoids wrapped in large-font breathlessness. <b>Readers are more likely to crave calm distillation of meaningful themes and trends.</b><br>

 <p><b>$$$</b>:</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>In a news-feed environment where readers encounter a mix of free and paywalled content, there is a real question whether they’ll be willing subscribe to a multitude of different publications. If they don’t, it’s almost inevitable that the platforms will urge publishers to blend and bundle multiple titles into a single coherent subscription package. And publishers will find themselves with a Hobson’s choice: Try to drive standalone subscriptions in a crowded marketplace, where only a few thrive. Or give in to bundling and turn over to the platforms their relationship with the reader in return for fractional shares of the bundled price.<br>

 <blockquote>
  <p>Either Facebook and Google are platforms, in which case they need to manage their infrastructure in a way that allows independent journalism to thrive. Or they are publishers, in which case they need to provide direct financial support for the journalism their platforms deliver.<br>
   Simply put, that either means providing tools for publishers to manage their business on the platforms (via APIs and direct ownership of the customer). Or it means paying publishers for their content.<br>

  <p>An important prospect about the role of personalized content in media today: the same technology, executed strategically and tactically, could allow media companies to address gaps in public knowledge, or solve specific informational needs. I believe this shift to psychographic, micro-targeted media will be the biggest evolution for publishers in the next 3 to 5 years. Every content generated will be targeted to specific needs and profiles, instead of a mass audience.</p>
  <p>There are several important benefits for the industry in the shift to micro-targeting. We’d actually seek out problems to solve; we’ll be rewarded by engagement and, therefore, revenue. We’ll also reduce wastage in output - costly operations of content teams that churn out content that never gets seen or read.</p>
  <p>The defining questions for every journalist in the age of micro-targeting will be: Who is this piece of content for? How do I make sure it reaches them?<br>

   <p>It will be left to individual communities to take responsibility for their own local news and information needs, and support grassroots replacements of what is lost. In almost every case, that will take a patchwork quilt of solutions — a general-interest local online news site, a niche nonprofit going in-depth on one particular topic, public radio, a local access cable television station, the library, activists, Facebook groups, and the closest surviving metro, all playing off each other, and maybe even collaborating. In some cases, that’s giving voice to people and communities who were never well-served by newspapers and producing journalism on niche topics that was never pursued adequately under the legacy structure, even in the glory days.</p>
   <p><b>In some ways, it’s a great equalizer.

  <p>Basically, we peddle today’s news while failing to put at readers’ disposal everything else that’s ever happened and been reported on.

  <p>Modern totalitarian regimes do not exercise monopoly control over narrative. Rather, they use a variety of technological and organic means to make competing narratives inaccessible to or untrusted by the public. Hordes of bots and people who talk like bots invade competing hashtags and disrupt political communication. Weaponized transparency, defended by free speech advocates, is used to overwhelm the public’s capacity to separate fact from fiction. Speech - whether automated or organized - is being used strategically to prevent access to information the public needs to govern itself.</p>
  <p>In such a world, <b>we will start to see people, out of necessity, peel apart the right to free speech from the right to be informed. </b>The right to be informed will need to take into account the limits of attention and the way bad information can be used to crowd out good. It will take into account the deleterious effects of information overload, and wrestle with the impact of systemic harassment in wiping out minority voices. This evolved conception of free speech as a right to expression that sometimes conflicts with a parallel right to be informed will begin to form a legal, technical, and educational framework.<br>

<p>Mas de <b>$$$</b> temos que deixar à posteridade o nosso resumo de uma peça com o estranho título <em>publicidade honesta</em>, de onde retirámos também a citação inicial.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Media and journalism aren’t in trouble. It’s the business of media and journalism that is, and that’s what we need to fix.</strong><br>

<p><small>Arriscamos a dar um segundo sentido -este, não intencional- ao nosso título: no <i><b>NL</b></i> continuam a publicar peças além da data limite. Mais sobre o digital, mais sobre <b>$$$</b>, mais sobre transparência e AI, e transversal a todas as peças a aparente inabalável fé que a imprensa está cá para sempre, a realidade de alguma forma tem que se ajustar à sua importância. Voltaremos aqui, antes, os nossos acrescentos.</small></p>

<p><b>Whether it is to inform citizens, or to affect perceptions about their reality, the media needs a transformational purpose.</b></p>
<p>The debate is still open about where journalism ends and advocacy begins, and it is important for journalists to keep an attentive eye on those lines. However, very few will now debate that journalism has a mission — it always has. Media is, at its best, at the forefront of halting the biggest abuses. At a minimum, it is capable of defining conversations and setting the agenda.</p>
<p>I would say all media organizations believe that they tell stories and provide information because they want to help their audience to make better choices, be aware of something, or change their social and political environments for the better. To achieve systematic change, media needs deep structural relationships with the community they serve, and take the media-driven effects to meaningful collective impact.</p>

<p>In 2018, the Empire will strike back.</p>
<p>Net neutrality is on the brink of extinction. Facebook, Amazon, and Google continue to build up massive data network effects that are harder and harder for new entrants and old media institutions to overcome. And the core values of a democratic society will continue to be chipped away until what was once considered abhorrent behavior will now be considered “just the way it is,” because we become more tired and less shocked every single day.
In tech, the last year has starkly shown us that while technology can be leveraged for massive good, it can also be leveraged for massive evil. 2018 will be the year in which everyone in technology is obliged to look in the mirror and ask themselves not just whether their intentions are good enough, but whether their actions are strong enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Usage of Facebook has begun to decline as the conversations there become more and more toxic. Soon the only discourse available will be about the most outrageous, instinct-punching statements, free of fact or reasoned debate, and the only people who will remain are those who seek nothing but self-validation and protection from criticism.</p>
<p>Information was increasingly being shared in places that were not publicly accessible, searchable, or discoverable - imposed on users invisibly, by design and by algorithm, spaces that could be used to share intelligent thought are becoming isolated and increasingly toxic. The outcome is the intellectual equivalent of the Dead Sea: an environment cut off from inflows or outflows, slowly becoming less and less habitable to life, until all that are left are the hardiest extremophiles.</p>
<p>What we can do as journalists is to demand systems that provide readers with the unexpected, that which surprises and challenges them. <b>The maddening thing about this situation is that news organizations have historically been very good at showing people novel information, and at challenging their assumptions. The very layout of the newspaper encouraged discovery and serendipity, qualities that most online news experiences lack.</b> By adding information diversity as a consideration, readers will be better informed and publishers’ relationships with them will deepen. As things stand now, these filters fail at the most basic value a news organization can provide — “Tell me something I don’t know” — in favor of a far more dangerous value: “Tell me what I want to hear.”</p>
