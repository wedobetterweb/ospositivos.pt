The punk scene that launched cartoonists Panter and Groening was part of a larger punk movement that hit America, and the UK, in the mid-to-late 1970s. Both political and aesthetic, the punk movement, which often registered as a visceral or even violent response to mainstream pop culture, encouraged people to create their own culture across many different forms of production. This includes, most famously, the music that came to be known as punk rock. Punk culture often consolidated around bands, along with the art and graphic design that went into their promotion - as well as the fanzines that articulated their ideas and goals. The &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; ethic is the defining feature of punk culture and production. in &quot;Gary Panter, Matt Groening, and the Dual History of Punk and Comics&quot; 11 dez 2017 Com comics e fanzines porque de repente não se consegue escrever a história da BD sem estes - e nem o spandex escapa. Fanzines link punk (a historical movement and ongoing system of values that prizes independence at the level of creation) and comics (an art form conventionally designed for print circulation) directly. Zines, as today they are commonly known, are independently published periodicals on a range of topics. The roots of zines and comics run deep together: teenage writer/artist team Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster published the earliest incarnation of Superman in 1933 in their very own mimeographed fanzine Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization. And zines, with their DIY ethic, are a cornerstone of punk philosophy and its music specifically: they represent independence from the corporate, the building of community through the circulation and exchange of knowledge, and a forum for promoting bands. One sees in punk zines just how key the frisson between words and images that motors comics is to the punk aesthetic. in &quot;Gary Panter, Matt Groening, and the Dual History of Punk and Comics&quot; 11 dez 2017 Voltando ao Matt G, 1977, the year Panter and Groening both moved to the city. Art Spiegelman first knew Groening as &quot;Gary’s punk rock friend.&quot; The two met and became fast friends, plotting how to make art people would pay attention to.

  <p>A sua relação ao punk -recordamos: a ser inventado nesse mesmo momento- resulta do lado <em>artsy, versus politics</em>. Um feliz excerto da autora consegue enrolar na descrição aqueles nossos infelizes habituais:</p>

    <p>Panter explains, &quot;I’d seen something in the paper about punks, and I thought, these are like <b>creepy little neo-Nazis</b>, you know—what a bunch of jerks. But mostly it was people out of <b>art school</b> who wanted to make something happen.&quot;<br>

  <p>Punk, punk:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Punk&quot; was a term for disrepute and outsiderness, resignified in the 1970s as an expressive, antiestablishment rejection of the &quot;expert&quot; and the corporate - <span class="voice">[a]</span> movement characterized by short, sped-up rock songs and anti-conformism.</p>
    <p>The punk scene that launched cartoonists Panter and Groening was part of a larger punk movement that hit America, and the UK, in the mid-to-late 1970s. Both political and aesthetic, the punk movement, which often registered as a visceral or even violent response to mainstream pop culture, encouraged people to create their own culture across many different forms of production. This includes, most famously, the music that came to be known as punk rock. Punk culture often consolidated around bands, along with the art and graphic design that went into their promotion - <b>as well as the fanzines that articulated their ideas and goals</b>. The &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; ethic is the defining feature of punk culture and production.<br>

  <p>Com <em>comics</em> e fanzines porque de repente não se consegue escrever a história da BD sem estes - e nem o <em>spandex</em> escapa.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Fanzines link punk (a historical movement and ongoing system of values that prizes independence at the level of creation) and comics (an art form conventionally designed for print circulation) directly. Zines, as today they are commonly known, are independently published periodicals on a range of topics. The roots of zines and comics run deep together: teenage writer/artist team Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster published the earliest incarnation of Superman in 1933 in their very own mimeographed fanzine Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization. </p>
    <p>And zines, with their DIY ethic, are a cornerstone of punk philosophy and its music specifically: they represent independence from the corporate, the building of community through the circulation and exchange of knowledge, and a forum for promoting bands. One sees in punk zines just how key the frisson between words and images that motors comics is to the punk aesthetic.<br>

    <p>Groening and Panter’s career trajectories demonstrate punk’s role in contemporary comics - and also how the graphic novel today<b> trades on so many of its values</b>, including <strong>an emphasis on immediacy and the handmade</strong>, <b>for what is now a mainstream audience</b>. <br>

  <p>O que nos recorda: demasiados punks para a esquerda e para a direita hoje em dia. Punks, a fazer fé, aos pontapés. Punks que caem do céu como perdigotos <em>in ur face</em>... Já renegamos os <em>comics</em>, hoje queremos distância ao <em>&quot;punk&quot;</em>, os <em>artsy-f </em>dão-lhe mais uso que nós e despacham-no com(o) estilo. Guardem-no, <strong>nós ficamo-nos por vândalos e <em>hooligans</em>,</strong> é-nos mais próximo de intenções.</p>
