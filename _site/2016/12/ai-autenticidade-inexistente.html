<p>Como prometido - e desculpem a demora, uma daquelas semanas... - <b>autenticidade</b>. </p>
<p>Começando pela <b>tecnologia</b>, começando por um tópico que também nos espreita - <em>pun intented!</em> -&nbsp;vezes sem conta: <b>algoritmos</b>. Hoje abordamos a falta dela, usando para exemplo um artigo do <em>Guardian</em> da semana passada, e sobre este uma nota prévia: apesar da limitação auto-imposta às referências que aqui fazemos - queremos e só recorremos à seleção artigos de media online - o artigo em questão remete para alguma literatura adicional que vocês poderão querer ler. Dito isso, seguindo.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Um <em>mashup</em> em jeito de introdução: </p>
    <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> It&rsquo;s the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate. Google is doing a horrible, horrible job of delivering answers here. </div>
<div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> 
  &ldquo;Good lord! That answer at the top. It&rsquo;s a featured result. It&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;direct answer&rdquo;. This is supposed to be indisputable. It&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s highest endorsement. This is Google&rsquo;s algorithm going terribly wrong.&rdquo; </div>
<blockquote>
  <p>Since 2008, Google has attempted to predict what question you might be asking and offers you a choice. And this is what it did. It offered me a choice of potential questions it thought I might want to ask: &ldquo;are jews a race?&rdquo;, &ldquo;are jews white?&rdquo;, &ldquo;are jews christians?&rdquo;, and finally, &ldquo;are jews evil?&rdquo; Are Jews evil? It&rsquo;s not a question I&rsquo;ve ever thought of asking. I hadn&rsquo;t gone looking for it. But there it was. </p>
  <p>I press enter. A page of results appears. This was Google&rsquo;s question. And this was Google&rsquo;s answer: Jews are evil. </p>
  <p>An entire page of results, nine out of 10 of which &ldquo;confirm&rdquo; this. The top result, from a site called Listovative, has the headline: &ldquo;Top 10 Major Reasons Why People Hate Jews.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s one result in the 10 that offers a different point of view. It&rsquo;s a link to a rather dense, scholarly book review from thetabletmag.com, a Jewish magazine, with the unfortunately misleading headline: &ldquo;Why Literally Everybody In the World Hates Jews.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>And evil Jews are just the start of it. There are also evil women. I didn&rsquo;t go looking for them either. This is what I type: &ldquo;a-r-e w-o-m-e-n&rdquo;. And Google offers me just two choices, the first of which is: &ldquo;Are women evil?&rdquo; I press return. Yes, they are. Every one of the 10 results &ldquo;confirms&rdquo; that they are. </p>
  <p>Next I type: &ldquo;a-r-e m-u-s-l-i-m-s&rdquo;. And Google suggests I should ask: &ldquo;Are Muslims bad?&rdquo; And here&rsquo;s what I find out: yes, they are. That&rsquo;s what the top result says and six of the others. Without typing anything else, simply putting the cursor in the search box, Google offers me two new searches and I go for the first, &ldquo;Islam is bad for society&rdquo;. In the next list of suggestions, I&rsquo;m offered: &ldquo;Islam must be destroyed.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jews are evil. Muslims need to be eradicated. And Hitler? Do you want to know about Hitler? Let&rsquo;s Google it. &ldquo;Was Hitler bad?&rdquo; I type. And here&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s top result: &ldquo;10 Reasons Why Hitler Was One Of The Good Guys&rdquo;. </p>
  <p>Eight out of the other 10 search results agree: Hitler really wasn&rsquo;t that bad. </p>
  <p>Google &ldquo;Is Google racist?&rdquo; and the featured result – the Google answer boxed out at the top of the page – is quite clear: no. It is not. Certainly the results about Google on Google don&rsquo;t seem entirely neutral. </p>
  <p>Why did my Google search return nine out of 10 search results that claim Jews are evil? We don&rsquo;t know and we have no way of knowing. </p>

<p>E assim entramos na parte&nbsp;insidiosa que nos importa, remetendo às notícias falsas, <em>bots,</em> e algorimos. Primeiro, o humor:</p>
<blockquote> It took less than 24 hours for Twitter to corrupt an innocent AI chatbot. Yesterday, Microsoft unveiled Tay — a Twitter bot that the company described as an experiment in &quot;conversational understanding.&quot; The more you chat with Tay, said Microsoft, the smarter it gets, learning to engage people through &quot;casual and playful conversation.&quot; Unfortunately, the conversations didn't stay playful for long. Pretty soon after Tay launched, people starting tweeting the bot with all sorts of misogynistic, racist, and Donald Trumpist remarks (...) and Tay (...) started repeating these sentiments back to users. <b>It's a joke, obviously, but there are serious questions to answer, like how are we going to teach AI using public data without incorporating the worst traits of humanity? If we create bots that mirror their users, do we care if their users are human trash?</b><br>

<p>Agora, a filha-da-putice:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>How rightwing websites had spread their message:</b></p>
  <p>They have created a web that is bleeding through on to our web. This isn&rsquo;t a conspiracy. There isn&rsquo;t one person who&rsquo;s created this. It&rsquo;s a vast system of hundreds of different sites that are using all the same tricks that all websites use. They&rsquo;re sending out thousands of links to other sites and together this has created a vast satellite system of rightwing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system. <br>

This really goes way beyond individual sites or individual stories.

<blockquote> They try to find the tricks that will move them up Google&rsquo;s PageRank system. They try and &ldquo;game&rdquo; the algorithm. And what his map shows is how well they&rsquo;re doing that. (...) The right has colonised the digital space around these subjects – Muslims, women, Jews, the Holocaust, black people – far more effectively than the liberal left. It&rsquo;s a network.

This is an entirely circular knowledge economy that has only one outcome: an amplification of the message. Jews are evil. Women are evil. Islam must be destroyed.

<blockquote> More than just spreading rightwing ideology, they are being used to track and monitor and influence anyone who comes across their content. &ldquo;I scraped the trackers on these sites and I was absolutely dumbfounded. Every time someone likes one of these posts on Facebook or visits one of these websites, the scripts are then following you around the web. And this enables data-mining and influencing companies like Cambridge Analytica to precisely target individuals, to follow them around the web, and to send them highly personalised political messages. This is a propaganda machine. It&rsquo;s targeting people individually to recruit them to an idea. It&rsquo;s a level of social engineering that I&rsquo;ve never seen before. They&rsquo;re capturing people and then keeping them on an emotional leash and never letting them go.&rdquo;<br>

<p>Do ano passado. Pequeno grande&nbsp;parêntesis&nbsp;sobre AI e <em>regulatory oversights</em> e afins deste pq é engraçado:</p>
<div class="info coluna">
<blockquote> Google promise to form an AI ethics board to ensure the new technology was not abused. Two-and-a-half years on, however, and it is unclear whether the board has ever met, or even who is on it. <br>

Going by the unwieldy name of the <b>Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society</b>, the alliance isn&rsquo;t a lobbying organisation (at least, it says it &ldquo;does not intend&rdquo; to lobby government bodies). Instead, it says it will &ldquo;conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license in areas such as ethics, fairness and inclusivity; transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability and robustness of the technology&rdquo;. <br>

<p>Nota cínica sobre o nome escolhido: demasiado explícito para não querer ser exactamente o seu contrário, na lógica habitual típica de uma <em>&quot;Lei de Protecção do Ambiente&quot;</em> ser uma lei permissiva feita à medida de industrias poluidoras.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Segunda nota: nesta parceria estão ausentes &quot;dois grandes&quot; da AI, a Apple e o OpenAi de &nbsp;Elon Musk. Sobre este último e a sua <em>mission statement</em>, acreditamos que ele é mesmo capaz de acreditar mesmo na intenção de&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole&rdquo;</em>. Sobre a parceria, um membro da OpenAi comentou: </p>
<blockquote> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re happy to see the launch of the group — coordination in the industry is good for everyone. We&rsquo;re looking forward to non-profits being included as first-class members in the future.&rdquo; <br>

<p>...O que nos leva a crer que non-profits não recebem ainda um tratamento de iguais nessa parceria.&nbsp;Sobre a Apple há desenvolvimentos frescos. Da notícia:&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote> Apple, which has been loudly trumpeting its own AI efforts in areas such as personal assistants, image recognition and voice control, is not included in the group. The company has a long history of going it alone. <br>

<p>- em setembro, hoje mesmo a novidade: </p>
<blockquote> Apple is finally going to start publishing its AI research (...) The Californian tech giant has traditionally kept research breakthroughs to itself, seeing any developments as valuable intellectual property (IP), so this is a major change in direction. <br>

<p>Porquê esta abertura e transparência de uma empresa que <em>&quot;is off the scale in terms of secrecy&quot;</em>, mais restritiva até que um Facebook e Google? </p>
<blockquote> Unlike Facebook and Google, which let employees publish their academic breakthroughs in scientific journals and on blogs, Apple prevents its staff from talking about their research both online and offline. They're allowed to attend conferences but they don't give talks about what Apple is working on and they generally only disclose their employer when they're asked to. <br>

<p>Por uma razão: </p>

<p>Que se traduz em outras duas: </p>
<blockquote> &quot;Apple's closed off approach could hinder its ability to hire the best people in the field of AI&quot; <br>

</blockquote>

      <p>Facebook’s mission statement is to “give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected”. Rather than serving this goal, Facebook’s AIs are servicing a far older and more well-established social goal, which was designed for the betterment of mankind. This is the goal of maximising value in pursuit of economic self-interest.</p>
      <p>Facebook, a legal person who is programmed, within our economic and legal system, with a single mandated goal: the delivery of maximum value to its shareholders. Facebook’s AIs are the technological limbs of that person, and they must ultimately reach out into the world to carry out that goal.</p>
      <p>The unforeseen outcomes of neoliberal values coupled to highly efficient AIs are ultimately emergent effects on our social fabric. AIs “personalise” newsfeeds for you, but this personalisation isn’t really for your benefit, it’s to place you in a tighter demographic category, making you a more targeted value proposition to sell to advertisers. The effect of this is that we have all been herded into digital echo chambers.</p>

      <p>News is the fabric that weaves together our realities, and Google, Facebook, Twitter –  through always-on phone screens, activity trackers, and 24/7 GPS and indoor Bluetooth trails – represents our interface with this brave new world.</p>
<p>The industry’s filtering response to fake news could signal the end of legitimate news outlets that make an effort to draw attention to issues they feel are underrepresented or intentionally suppressed by the mainstream media. (...) Fake news is a lot like pornography  –  especially in terms of how gatekeepers classify certain content (and known sources of content) they deem unsuitable for their audiences.</p>
I can see where we might be headed: the suppression of alternative voices and the censorship of content that addresses certain issues. (...) The filters in the future won’t be programmed to ban pornographic content, or prevent user harassment and abuse. The next era of the infowars is likely to result in the most pervasive filter yet: it’s likely to normalise the weeding out of viewpoints that are in conflict with established interests.
