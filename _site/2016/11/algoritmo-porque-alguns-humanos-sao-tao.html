  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> Although  it would be simplistic to hang the global surge of nationalism and far-right  thinking on Facebook&rsquo;s algorithms alone, it is undeniable how fast these  nationalist far-right political movements are growing, thanks to some key  changes Facebook made to its News Feed in 2014.</div>
  <p>Nos artigos anteriores preocupámo-nos com a influência das  redes sociais sobre os media e a deturpação de factos –puta mentira mesmo- que  nestas circulam, e, particularmente, nessa nota focámo-nos na reação da  imprensa. Como notámos do rescaldo das eleições norte-americanas (período  conhecido por gerações vindouras –as que sobreviverem ie- como o <em>&ldquo;advento do anti-cristo&rdquo;</em>), a imprensa  fez então um sentido <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2016/11/mic-drop.html"><em>mea culpa</em></a> antes de recuperar do choque e apontar baterias às redes sociais: particularmente ao <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2016/11/face-it.html">Facebook</a> e passando algo ao lado do <a href="http://www.ospositivos.com/2016/11/140-chars-ou-menos.html">Twitter</a> – peculiaridade curiosa já que o  presidente-eleito deu uma preferência óbvia ao segundo mas desculpa-se quando  nos recordamos que nada desses temas é novidade ao mesmo vai para uma década. </p>
  <p>Nessa reação, vimos surgir uma pequena linha de argumentação  da qual fomos rápidos a suspeitar na altura:</p>
  <blockquote> A culpa é do  algoritmo. Certo e voltaremos a este ponto adiante.<br>
  <small>In Real Nós</small> </blockquote>
  <blockquote> Aquilo dos algoritmos  - começas a perceber a tendência? <br>
  <small>In Real Nós</small> </blockquote>
  <blockquote> <b>A culpa é do  algoritmo. </b>E essa é apenas a deixa.<br>
  <small>In Real Nós</small> </blockquote>
  <p>...e que tendo entretanto feito o seu  percurso de maturação entre os dizeres dos <em>4th  State</em> fez o seu assalto final nos editoriais do fim-de-semana passado. A mensagem? </p>
  <blockquote>
    <h3><strong>This is a job for people, not algorithms.</strong></h3>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Ou, como o suspeitávamos das nossas  notas anteriores, a César o que é de César, e este insiste na exclusividade de único <em>gatekeeper</em> legítimo. Como dizíamos:</p>
  <blockquote>Essencialmente,  rescrever o algoritmo, ou, melhor ainda, substitui-lo por pessoas. Talvez,  pessoas qualificadas na avaliação do que é digno ou indigno de nota e notícia.  Assim que, por exemplo, jornalistas encartados? Afinal, é bom para o Facebook e  para o jornalismo. Senhoras e senhores, o FB é o <em>sewer</em> da idade digital, o pior que aconteceu ao jornalismo, mas, e já que o  jornalismo está nas lonas e não o podes vencer – eles não o dizem mas ressalta  na leitura de toda a desarmonia- e porque não te juntares a ele?<br>
    In Real Nós</blockquote>
  <p>Como resolver o problema das notícias  falsas do Facebook e afins? A resposta –do lado dos media- parece ser <em>&ldquo;mais jornalistas&rdquo;</em>. A felicidade de  solução não passa despercebida mas voltaremos à crise da imprensa às mãos do  digital – outra vez- adiante. Para já, uma pequena-longa sequência de excertos que  confrontam o debate: </p>
  <blockquote> What's  certain is that fake news on Facebook is a symptom of a larger problem: the  company is trying to play contradictory roles as both trustworthy news  publisher and fun social media platform for personal sharing. The problem is  that it cannot be both<br>
    <small>in <a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/2016/11/its-time-to-get-rid-of-the-facebook-news-feed-because-its-not-news/" target="_blank"><em>&quot;It&rsquo;s time to get rid of the Facebook &ldquo;news feed,&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s not news&quot;</em></a> <sup>19 nov  2016</sup></small></blockquote>
  <p>Primeiro, que  algoritmos?</p>
  <blockquote> When you  log into your Facebook account, your default page is dominated by a cascading  &quot;news feed,&quot; automatically selected for your pleasure (...) The  company uses a mix of secret-sauce algorithms to choose which pieces of news  you see.<br>
  <small>in <a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/2016/11/its-time-to-get-rid-of-the-facebook-news-feed-because-its-not-news/" target="_blank"><em>&quot;It&rsquo;s time to get rid of the Facebook &ldquo;news feed,&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s not news&quot;</em></a> <sup>19 nov  2016</sup></small></blockquote>
  <blockquote> Algorithms  identify that a user likes one particular page and suggest others, creating an  echo-chamber effect that can lead to some pretty scary places. For instance,  after a user likes the Australian United Patriots Front page, Facebook suggests  more pages to like, such as the National Democratic Party of Australia and Stop  The Mosque In Narre Warren. The Britain First page lists Christian Fightback  News and Donald Trump as pages you should like next. Facebook&rsquo;s recommendation  engines appear to promote political ideology like any other kind of content,  pushing users even deeper.<br>
    <small>in <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/the-far-right-is-a-meme" target="_blank"><em>&quot;This Is  How Facebook Is Radicalizing You&quot;</em></a> <sup>16 nov 2016</sup></small></blockquote>
  <blockquote> Facebook in particular faces a  more fundamental issue given the ways in which its algorithm selects posts: if  users engage more with fake news than real news, as seems possible, then  Facebook&rsquo;s algorithm will promote the fake news.<br>
    <small>in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/15/facebook-google-fake-news-sites-ad-networks" target="_blank"><em>&quot;Facebook and Google move to  kick fake news sites off their ad networks&quot;</em></a> <sup>15 nov  2016</sup></small></blockquote>
  <p>E aqui introduzimos o primeiro grande  senão. Estes automatismos não são o resultado de uma AI <em>godsen </em>de intenções benevolentes. O <em>drive</em> é o  de sempre:</p>
  <blockquote> While  Facebook&rsquo;s algorithm appears to emphasize newness and popularity, it has also  done everything to make sure users stay within the app for as long as possible.  (…) Facebook doesn&rsquo;t want to challenge you, they don&rsquo;t want to upset you,  because they know that if you&rsquo;re challenged on their platform, you wouldn&rsquo;t  want to use it as much<br>
  <small>in <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/the-far-right-is-a-meme" target="_blank"><em>&quot;This Is  How Facebook Is Radicalizing You&quot;</em></a> <sup>16 nov 2016</sup></small></blockquote>
  <blockquote>Given  that Facebook's main goal is to serve you ads and get you to buy things, their  number-one priority is keeping you glued to your feed. If you see a bunch of  things you hate in your feed, you're going to stop looking at it and take your  clicks elsewhere. Common sense dictates that Facebook should avoid showing you  news that will upset you or make you angry. (…) Their business depends on it.<br>

  <p>…Com um <em>twist</em> para o <em>dark</em>. Por um  lado, essa manipulação combina diferentes fontes sem distinção, na prática equiparando-as,  descaracterizando-as, dificultando a sua verificação. O que o teu avô racista e  o conglomerado de empresas do Roberto Murdoc dizem vale o mesmo:</p>
  <blockquote> Though  there's something ineffably creepy about Facebook manipulating our emotions,  the site is no different than any other ad-driven business. (…) Facebook's big  innovation was the discovery that it could sell ads against people's friendship  networks. (...) The problem is that Facebook decided to go beyond friendship  networks. For several years now, the company has courted professional news  outlets, ranging from the New York Times and BuzzFeed to Breitbart and FOX  News, promising them prominent placement in users' feeds. (…) But then, earlier  this year, Facebook announced that it would no longer be giving special weight  to news coming from pages that belong to media outlets. From that point on,  they would be weighting news from &quot;friends and family&quot; more heavily  than from news outlets. Your news feed would not discriminate between stuff  your friends passed along and news sources.<br>

  <p>Por  outro lado eleva a destaque um subconjunto dessas escolhas:</p>
  <blockquote> This rule  had one exception. To the right of the news feed on your default Facebook page  is the &quot;trending&quot; module. For a while, Facebook had a team of human  editors who curated trending news from a long list of reputable sources. But  Facebook fired them and set up an algorithm to take their places. With no human  checks on it, that algorithm immediately started posting fake news. Facebook's  algorithms are great at keeping people glued to their screens, but they are  terrible at distinguishing real news from fake.<br>

  <p>Independentemente  do que o FB admita ou como o entenda, em ambos os casos é feita uma selecção  que obedece a critérios definidos que se escusam atrás do tal algoritmo. Sobre  a &ldquo;objectividade&rdquo; * deste, um longo resumo, suficientemente claro no <em>humans do it</em> <em>best</em> mas sem entrar na histeria do jornalista encartado:</p>
  <p><small>* Tal como já falamos da objectividade dos jornalistas.</small></p>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote> In its  early days, Google was bombarded with complaints about its search-ranking: the  proprietors of low-ranked sites insisted that Google had insulted them by not  ranking them higher, and wanted to know how they could improve their ranking  and thus make more money, command more attention, and increase their influence.  (…) Google's initial response was to hide behind machine objectivity: &quot;Our  algorithm has downranked you because your site does not have the mathematical  correlates of quality and relevance. You can't argue with math. If you want a  higher ranking, make a better site.&quot; (…) This, of course, was not true.  The decisions that Google makes to assign high scores to certain metrics (lots  of inbound links, or lots of clicks, or certain properties of language) and  downrank others (slow loading, inbound links from known &quot;bad&quot; sites,  etc) reflects human, editorial judgment. (… )True or not, it gave Google a  readymade and unassailable response to people who didn't like their search  results (…) But this position had a serious flaw: if Google's results are the  product of math, not human expression, then there is no free speech interest in  protecting those results. The entertainment industry was the first to advance  this argument -- to governments, not Google -- demanding that their sites be  top-ranked for searches, and that &quot;pirate&quot; sites be downranked. <br>
      Governments  were fairly receptive to this argument, and that opened the floodgates. Soon,  everyone was in on the act: there is literally no end to the constituencies who  feel like they have a legitimate interest in tweaking Google's search results.  (…) In 2012, Google had had enough. They commissioned Eugen Volokh, the famed  First Amendment legal scholar, to write a legal white-paper explaining that  search results were indeed the result of human judgment, and had been all  along. The government doesn't barge into the New York Times editorial meeting  and dictate which stories will go above the fold of tomorrow's edition -- they  have no more business telling Google which results come first in search  results.
      <p>Facebook  is now edging into the same territory, by much the same route. Since its first  blush of popularity, Facebook has maintained that its algorithm was assembling  your feed based on some objective notion of &quot;relevance,&quot; not the  human judgment of its human masters. Now, with governments rattling their  sabers, and the election-haunted public howling for blood, Facebook is moving  through the journey Google began in 2012. A few days ago, Zuckerberg was  saying, &quot;Facebook can't be the arbiter of truth,&quot; and now the company  is signalling that it will be just that.   I am just as worried as can be that Facebook's war on &quot;fake news&quot;  will end up catching a lot of important stories that are not fake -- stories  that are urgent, like the North Dakota pipeline tragedy, which keeps getting  worse, and which requires realtime access to attention at key moments lest it  become a massacre. But Facebook isn't moving from &quot;not exercising editorial  judgment&quot; to &quot;adding editorial to the algorithm.&quot; The algorithm  is editorial, and it has been since the first time a programmer looked at the  results of a test suite and found them satisfying. </p>
      <p>Machine  learning is in a crisis. The illusion of algorithmic objectivity is driving  racist policing and incarceration under the guise of empirical, evidence-based  crime-fighting. Like Facebook's algorithm, like Google's search ranking,  predictive policing, automated sentencing reviews, and other systems of  computer-aided judgment can be programmed to make good judgments or bad ones,  and ultimately, the difference is something that humans, not computers, will  have to determine. Facebook could get it horribly wrong with its &quot;fake  news&quot; filter, but the problem won't be that Facebook has decided to filter  based on content, it will be that its content filter sucks. </p>
      <p><b>Facebook, like Google, is a content filter.</b></p>

  </div>
  <p>E  agora com mais fervor nas opiniões: porque o FB não se pode dar ao luxo de se desposar  da defesa de supostos automatismos nem admitir ao mesmo tempo que pratica algum  tipo de linha editoral.</p>
  <blockquote> <b>If those publications post articles that are libelous,  infringing, obscene, or otherwise unlawful, they can be held liable in a court  of law for what they've published. </b>
    <p>Think  about two rules that the US legal system uses to regulate the news media. One  is the First Amendment, which has been interpreted to mean that a publisher has  the right to publish lawful information without interference from the  government. The other is a rather obscure section of the Communications Decency  Act known as &quot;CDA 230.&quot; (…) Section 230 offers immunity from legal  prosecution to &quot;intermediaries&quot; or &quot;interactive computer  services&quot; who publish things created by other people. The classic example  of a person protected by CDA 230 is a blogger who allows open comments on their  stories. Under CDA 230, the blogger cannot be sued if a commenter says  something libelous or posts an infringing movie. The blogger is merely an &quot;intermediary&quot;  and thus does not bear responsibility for what commenters say. (…) Facebook  enjoys the protection of both the First Amendment and CDA 230, but CDA 230 is  key to its survival. It means that Facebook cannot be held liable for anything  posted on Facebook (…) But CDA 230 may not protect Facebook if the company  continues to use algorithms (…) If Facebook starts acting too much like a  publisher, or what CDA 230 calls an &quot;information content provider,&quot;  it may open itself up to liability. (…) Given that one of the traditional roles  of publishers is to choose which stories to show their readers, a court might  possibly decide that Facebook is actually a publisher. (…) CDA 230 provides  immunity for &quot;interactive computer services,&quot; drawing a line between  that category and &quot;information content providers.&quot; But it's not  entirely clear when the former becomes the latter; in other words, it's not  clear when an intermediary engages in enough editing of third-party content  that it becomes an &quot;information content provider&quot; </p>
    <p><b>Facebook wants to have it both ways, both ethically  and legally. </b></p>
    <p>The  company wants to be seen as a source of news. The company offers media outlets  a chance to use Facebook Instant, because having native content from the New  York Times enhances Facebook's credibility. And yet it also wants to retreat  into the safe harbor of being a mere intermediary that does not distinguish  between Uncle Tommy's rants and a Washington Post investigation. That's why  Zuckerberg has responded to criticisms of fake news by saying Facebook's job is  not to determine what's true. The company just officially banned fake news  sources from buying ads. Clearly, Zuckerberg et al know how to distinguish real  from fake, but are choosing to feign ignorance when it suits them. </p>
    <b>Almost nothing would get posted to Facebook if the  company had to take full legal responsibility for everything in the feed. </b><br>
    <small>in <a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/2016/11/its-time-to-get-rid-of-the-facebook-news-feed-because-its-not-news/" target="_blank"><em>&quot;It&rsquo;s time to get rid of the Facebook &ldquo;news feed,&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s not news&quot;</em></a> <sup>19 nov  2016</sup></small></blockquote>
  <p>Ou,  claro, &ldquo;aquela solução&rdquo;:</p>
  <blockquote> Or,  Facebook could keep walking the line, but in a much more honest fashion. It  might do this by creating a separate news section, curated in part by humans  and perhaps by better algorithms. This section could draw from a vast array of  professional media organizations, the same way Google News does. <br>
  <small>in <a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/2016/11/its-time-to-get-rid-of-the-facebook-news-feed-because-its-not-news/" target="_blank"><em>&quot;It&rsquo;s time to get rid of the Facebook &ldquo;news feed,&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s not news&quot;</em></a> <sup>19 nov  2016</sup></small></blockquote>
  <p>Os  editoriais de dois grandes jornais norte-americas não deixam dúvidas sobre essa  solução. Segue-se o apontar de dedo pelo <em>NY Times</em> e a feliz e inocente sugestão que  se insinua:</p>
  <blockquote> A big part of the  responsibility for this scourge rests with internet companies like Facebook and  Google, which have made it possible for fake news to be shared nearly instantly  with millions of users and have been slow to block it from their sites.
    <p>Facebook says it is working on  weeding out such fabrications. It said last Monday that it would no longer  place Facebook-powered ads on fake news websites, a move that could cost  Facebook and those fake news sites a lucrative source of revenue. Earlier on the  same day, Google said it would stop letting those sites use its ad placement  network. These steps would help, but Facebook, in particular, owes its users,  and democracy itself, far more.</p>
    <p>Facebook has demonstrated that  it can effectively block content like click-bait articles and spam from its  platform by tweaking its algorithms, which determine what links, photos and ads  users see in their news feeds. Nobody outside the company knows exactly how its  software works and why you might see posts shared by some of your friends  frequently and others rarely. Recently, the company acknowledged that it had  allowed businesses to target or exclude users for ads for housing, employment  and credit based on their ethnicity, in apparent violation of anti-discrimination  laws. It has said it will stop that practice.</p>
Facebook managers are  constantly changing and refining the algorithms, which means the system is  malleable and subject to human judgment.     <br>
   <small> in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/sunday/facebook-and-the-digital-virus-called-fake-news.html" target="_blank"><em>&quot;Facebook and the Digital Virus  Called Fake News&quot;</em></a> <sup>19 nov 2016</sup></small></blockquote>
  <p>Na  eventualidade de passar despercebido, o <em>Washington  Post</em> é francamente mais assertivo sobre essa sugestão:</p>
  <blockquote> <b>The social media companies must not duck this issue. </b>
    <p>It wasn&rsquo;t  all that long ago that the Internet was a wild west, where information ran  free. As Facebook, Google and Twitter grew, they celebrated this as a virtue,  insisting they were technology companies built on algorithms and not news media  outlets. But on the road to becoming true global giants, Facebook and the  others took on enormous new power to shape the information that people consume. </p>
    <p>A  distinction must be drawn between personal posts, which are best left largely  unfettered, and the news feed posts that can quickly go viral, accelerated by  algorithms that respond to user engagement. When these posts suddenly explode  and reach millions of people, social media essentially become news media. </p>
    <p><b>Fake news is dangerous mischief and takes advantage of  the fact that social media generally rely on rapid-fire algorithms and not  deliberate human editing. The social media services must adjust to the reality  that they now are news media outlets to some extent; that means relying more on  human editors to weed out the fake news.</b> The task  is delicate and requires balanced judgment. The aim must be not to censor free  expression or favor certain political views, but to guard against deception and  fraud. </p>
    <b>This is a job for people, not algorithms. </b><br>

    <blockquote><small> It goes to the heart of an open society,  and also is the key to their own credibility and survival. </small></blockquote>
    <p>Parece-nos  que a imprensa do antigamente deveria preocupar-se com a sua própria  credibilidade e sobrevivencia. Mas já ficamos felizes por tranquilamente  aceitarem o óbvio agora:</p>
    <blockquote><small> The Internet has become a vital forum for  democratic debate; it is essential that that interchange not be warped by  propaganda and lies.</small></blockquote>

  <p>São demasiadas vertentes para apurar de  uma só vez e faremos o tal <em>post</em> à  parte para as nossas conclusões. A terminar esta exposição só mais duas notas.  Primeiro, <em>é mais do que</em> o Facebook.  Apesar de se lançarem sobre este em particular pela particularidade da relação  entre ambos por via do ascendente que o FB tem sobre os media, é-nos claro que  este é um debate que deve ser feito no seio da Tecnologia, não de uma qualquer  companhia. <em>By no means</em>, um Google é  de forma alguma diferente, e ainda que os media não o possam acusar de  falsidades e outras distorções óbvias, não é necessário retroceder muito no  tempo para encontrar evidências dos arrufos entre ambos. Filtros, bolhas, <em>gatekeeping</em> e censura são apenas um dos muitos  tópicos que extravasam a difícil relação de <em>publishing  houses</em> a perder o controlo dos seus conteúdos.</p>
  <blockquote> Facebook is not alone in this. Google also  filters the search results based on your location and previous searches and  clicks. The social bubbles that Facebook and Google have designed for us are  shaping the reality <br>

  <p>Sobre essa perda de controlo falaremos nessa  próxima entrada. Esta mais não reflecte do que a inadequação da imprensa dos <em>old ways</em> a acompanhar os <em>new ways</em>. A avalanche de notícias falsas  é a sua prova: os habituais modelos de legitimação não só não cumpriram a sua função  como estavam totalmente ignorantes da discussão que se desenrolava num universo  que ainda lhes é estranho. Do CJR:</p>
  <blockquote> <b>Here in the  gap between the speed of the tech transformation and the recalcitrance of  changing media there are gleeful trolls spreading manic, entertaining garbage.</b>
    <p>Fake news—that is, hoaxes and  false and misleading stories from hyper-partisan and other sites—took advantage  of the widening gap between the booming platforms and legacy media companies. (…)  Most media companies are still spending the vast bulk of their reporting  resources on print, broadcast, or paywalled digital distribution that isn&rsquo;t  made for those spaces. Filling that gap is now a central challenge for media  and tech companies: How can media companies do professional journalism that  reaches audiences on the major platforms?<br>

  <p>Apesar da hesitação o FB fez uma  pequena inversão no discurso e já admite que tomará medidas no sentido de  limitar a proliferação de notícias falsas – sem, no entanto, deixar antever a  recriação da tal equipa editorial humanoide: o algoritmo <em>reigns supreme</em> no que lhes importa – e como também veremos, o mesmo  se aplica ao Google. Por via do habitual :)</p>

  <p> Mas, como o mesmo artigo salienta,  essa solução depende do mesmo jogo de gato e rato de sempre, e só aborda o <em>drive</em> porco-capitalista, não ataca o <em>troll</em> puro e duro. Para o bem ou para o  mal, fora da ganância do $$ a resistência é sempre maior.</p>

    <blockquote> Did we learn nothing about bad  information from dealing with junk rising in Google search results? Censorious  and offensive-to-free-speech-and-history European &ldquo;right to be forgotten&rdquo;  aside, bad information cannot be stomped out. The solution, we&rsquo;ve long since  learned, is to flood the zone with good information. (…) Media left the platform  of social media and the device of the meme to the fake-news factories (…)  Instead of complaining that Facebook doesn&rsquo;t send enough traffic to our  1,000-word articles that countless lost customers have demonstrated they don&rsquo;t  want to read, we should be going to the social platforms, speaking the language  there, respecting their context, and using the devices they provide — memes,  video, photos, dancing GIFs if that&rsquo;s what it takes — to bring journalistic  value to the conversations that now occur without us. (…) Instead of mourning  the creation of fake-news memes and putting the onus on Facebook to kill them  (again: do we really want that?) we should be pouring out our own truth  memes — with facts, fact-checking, context, explanation, education, reporting,  watch-dogging: journalism, in short.<br>

  <p>…e 2) que tal acabar de vez com a  ilusão do <em>gatekeepin&rsquo;</em>? Mais –repetição!-  no próximo <em>post</em>…</p>
  <blockquote> In both cases — media and  Facebook — I&rsquo;m suggesting that we inform and empower the users, the citizens,  the public to share smarter, more factual, more rational and reasonable  information. (…) Instead of concentrating on killing the bad, enable the good  and empower the user.</blockquote>
  <p>Puto: familiar?</p>
  <blockquote> Porque  achamos que o jornalismo é demasiado importante para ser deixado aos  jornalistas? Acabámos de demonstrar a falácia destes inúteis modernos.  Acreditar no potencial do jornalista crescido e alimentado numa redação  orientada ao mercado faz tanto sentido como acreditar que as jotinhas produzem  os bons políticos do amanhã. (...) A relação  Trump/media <sup>**</sup> é muito mais abrangente do que a aqui resumida a propósito da  falácia do jornalista profissional. Antes este era contido pelo establishment,  prevê-se que os novos powers that be os venham a perseguir: a importância do  public citizens playing an active role in the process of collecting, reporting,  analyzing, and disseminating news and information continua a ser a melhor  estratégia de resistência agora que o digital o suporta.<br>

<p>Adivinha-se uma relação difícil entre o presidente-eleito e a imprensa, uma que nos importa acompanhar para compreender a evolução dos media agora que dificilmente se poderá voltar aos bons velhos tempos do monopólio da comunicação - não queremos anunciar já que os <i>"gates r open"</i> porque podemos simplesmente estar a testemunhar o início de uma maior censura que  disfarça de comunicação directa monólogos de um só sentido. Enquanto acompanhamos os desenvolvimentos nessa frente falta-nos registar a também difícil relação dos media com as redes sociais, de que todas as nossas notas são apenas um longo registo de sintomas, não causas. Próximo: causas. E mais algumas conclusões pelo meio.</p>

<p>O site Sapo é ou não um meio de comunicação? Para a ERC, a resposta é sim e, como tal, deve respeitar a Lei de Imprensa e elaborar um estatuto editorial (...) a ERC emitiu um parecer em que concluía que “a página Sapo Notícias do portal Sapo constitui uma verdadeira publicação periódica electrónica, sujeita ao âmbito de aplicação da Lei de Imprensa”</p>
<p>Já a PT Comunicações defende que o site tem carácter multifuncional e é um agregador de conteúdos e por isso está excluído desta obrigação, acrescentando que “não preenche o conceito legal de imprensa”.</p>

<p><b>After years of rejecting the “media company” label, Twitter is indulging in some decidedly media company behaviors</b></p>
<p>At a time when social media companies shirk the “media company” label, Twitter seems to be embracing the role. (...) Whether Twitter says it or not, it’s clear the company wants to be more than simply a dumb pipe for programming created by others. Increasingly, Twitter seems to be positioning itself to procure, program and promote that media as well. (...) For Twitter, a definitive move into media at a time when larger rivals like Facebook dance and prevaricate around it, could be a savvy tactical decision. Twitter’s real-time nature makes it a great platform for breaking news funneled into it by others.</p>

<p>Facebook, he said, is not a "traditional" media company or a "traditional" technology company. (...) "Facebook is a new kind of platform," Zuckerberg said during the video chat. "It's not a traditional technology company. It's not a traditional media company. You know, we build technology and we feel responsible for how it's used. We don't write the news that people read on the platform, but at the same time we also know that we do a lot more than just distribute the news, and we're an important part of the public discourse."

<p>VALUED LIKE A TECH COMPANY: Wall Street prizes tech companies over media conglomerates, and rewards Silicon Valley’s innovators with a higher price-to-earnings ratio (...) "so if Zuckerberg wants to deflate (Facebook’s) value by like two-thirds, then by all means, be a media company".</p>
<p>LEGAL BENEFITS: certain legal advantages accrue to online platforms like Facebook that distribute content, but steer clear of creating it. Facebook benefits from an obscure provision of the Telecom Act of 1996 that shields online operators from liability associated with the speech and actions of third parties who use the site (...) “Traditional media companies do not enjoy the same degree of protection thus, Facebook doesn't want to lose that valuable legal shield from potentially onerous liability."</p>
<p>But try as it might to avoid the media label, Facebook’s editors and algorithms increasingly make judgment calls that would be familiar to anyone working in a newsroom. They’re arbiters in determining which articles and images to show. "That is front and center of what we do as journalists".</p>

<p>The former editor of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, estimated that Facebook had "sucked up $27 million" of the paper’s projected digital advertising revenue in the last year by essentially keeping Guardian readers on Facebook, rather than linking them to the Guardian site.
"They are taking all the money," he noted. "They have algorithms we don’t understand, which are a filter between what we do and how people receive it."</p>
