Ideologia per se: Ideology can refer to a systematic body of ideas articulated by a particular group of people; A second definition suggests a certain masking, distortion, or concealment. Ideology is used here to indicate how some texts and practices present distorted images of reality. They produce what is sometimes called ‘false consciousness’. Such distortions, it is argued, work in the interests of the powerful against the interests of the powerless (...) the subordinate classes do not see themselves as oppressed or exploited; ‘Ideological forms’: the way in which texts (television fiction, pop songs, novels, feature films, etc.) always present a particular image of the world. This definition depends on a notion of society as conflictual rather than consensual, structured around inequality, exploitation and oppression. Texts are said to take sides, consciously or unconsciously, in this conflict. Another way of saying this would be simply to argue that all texts are ultimately political. That is, they offer competing ideological significations of the way the world is or should be; Roland Barthes: ideology (or ‘myth’) operates mainly at the level of connotations, the secondary, often unconscious meanings that texts and practices carry, or can be made to carry - the attempt to make universal and legitimate what is in fact partial and particular; an attempt to pass off that which is cultural (i.e. humanly made) as something which is natural (i.e. just existing) Louis Althusser: ideology not simply as a body of ideas, but as a material practice: ideology is encountered in the practices of everyday life and not simply in certain ideas about everyday life - the way in which certain rituals and customs have the effect of binding us to the social order - ideology works to reproduce the social conditions and social relations necessary for the economic conditions and economic relations of capitalism to continue; V We-good?

Cultura popular então, na pequena parte que nos importa por agora: Antonio Gramsci, hegemony: the way in which dominant groups in society, through a process of ‘intellectual and moral leadership’, seek to win the consent of subordinate groups in society. Popular culture as a site of struggle between the ‘resistance’ of subordinate groups and the forces of ‘incorporation’ operating in the interests of dominant groups. John Fiske’s ‘semiotic’ use of Gramsci’s concept of hegemony: popular culture is what people make from the products of the culture industries – mass culture is the repertoire, popular culture is what people actively make from it, actually do with the commodities and commodified practices they consume.

Such distortions, it is argued, work in the interests of the powerful against the interests of the powerless (...) the subordinate classes do not see themselves as oppressed or exploited;</li>
      <li> ‘Ideological forms’: the way in which texts (television fiction, pop songs, novels, feature films, etc.) always present a particular image of the world.  This definition depends on a notion of society as conflictual rather than consensual, structured around inequality, exploitation and oppression. Texts are said to take sides, consciously or unconsciously, in this conflict.  Another way of saying this would be simply to argue that all texts are ultimately political. That is, they offer competing ideological significations of the way the world is or should be;</li>
      <li><b>Roland Barthes</b>: ideology (or ‘myth’) operates mainly at the level of connotations, the secondary, often unconscious meanings that texts and practices carry, or can be made to carry - the attempt to make universal and legitimate what is in fact partial and particular; an attempt to pass off that which is cultural (i.e. humanly made) as something which is natural (i.e. just existing)</li>
      <li><b>Louis Althusser</b>:  ideology not simply as a body of ideas, but as a material practice: ideology is encountered in the practices of everyday life and not simply in certain ideas about everyday life - the way in which certain rituals and customs have the effect of binding us to the social order - ideology works to reproduce the social conditions and social relations necessary for the economic conditions and economic relations of capitalism to continue;</li>

  <blockquote><b>Antonio Gramsci</b>, hegemony: the way in which dominant groups in society, through a process of ‘intellectual and moral leadership’, seek to win the consent of subordinate groups in society. <b>Popular culture as a site of struggle between the ‘resistance’ of subordinate groups and the forces of ‘incorporation’ operating in the interests of dominant groups</b>.</blockquote>
  <blockquote><b>John Fiske</b>’s ‘semiotic’ use of Gramsci’s concept of hegemony: popular culture is <b>what people make from the products of the culture industries</b> – mass culture is the repertoire, popular culture is what people actively make from it, actually do with the commodities and commodified practices they consume.</blockquote>

    <p>Bónus mas não relevante para hoje, ainda na cultura popular:</p>
    <blockquote>Postmodern culture is a culture that no longer recognizes the distinction between high and popular culture. For some this is a reason to <b>celebrate an end to an elitism</b> constructed on arbitrary distinctions of culture; for others it is a reason to despair at <b>the final victory of commerce over culture</b></blockquote>
