The Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines, or simply TEI, provide a scholarly encoding language for the digital representation and analysis of multitudinous and disparate document types: inscriptions and papyri; illuminated manuscripts; authorial holograph manuscripts; correspondence; printed books of prose, verse, and drama; critical and scholarly editions; and born-digital documents. TEI provides general purpose tags for encoding basic structural divisions (e.g., chapters, paragraphs, stanzas and lines of verse, and bibliographic citations) as well as very specific modules targeted at more specific content (e.g., manuscripts, dictionaries, and critical editions). in &quot;What is CBML?&quot; s/d Markup, u say? Markup is inserted into textual material not at random, but to convey some meaning. A markup language is a set of machine-readable textual codes, or &quot;tags,&quot; that are used to identify structure, semantics, and other features of documents and data. The application of these codes to a document is typically a necessary stage, often the most crucial and informative stage, of editing, analyzing, indexing publishing, visualizing, and otherwise studying or manipulating texts in digital environments. The act of encoding a document is a form of discovery, or prospecting, in which the encoder maps a document&#39;s structure, identifies semantic elements of interest, and documents relationships internal and external to the document. in &quot;Comic Book Markup Language: An Introduction and Rationale&quot; 2012 Segue-se o vosso digest.

The migration of comics content to digital reading devices, and the structural and aesthetic implications of that migration, call attention to the impact of the material characteristics of the comic book document. The structural, textual, visual, and bibliographic complexity of comic books make them an excellent subject for the general study of complex documents, especially documents combining pictorial and textual elements. Comic books are exceptionally complex documents, with intricate relationships between pictorial and textual elements and a wide variety of content types within a single comic book publication. The complexity of these documents, their combination of textual and pictorial elements, and the collaborative nature of their production shares much in common with other complex documents studied by humanists - illuminated manuscripts, artists&rsquo; books, illustrated poems, letterpress productions, illustrated children&rsquo;s books, and even Web pages and other born-digital media. in &quot;Comic Book Markup Language: An Introduction and Rationale&quot; 2012 Um estudo que não é de modo algum alheio ao livro impresso, mas capaz de imaginar além desse. In light of the ongoing cultural and scholarly relevance of comics, one goal of CBML is to support the study and analysis of comic books - even Web pages and other born-digital media.

The emphasis on both &quot;comics&quot; and &quot;books&quot; in the title of the language signals an awareness of the full range of content in the material artifact and the integration of comics content with related paratextual content.

    <p> iPhones and other smartphones have become  popular devices for reading newly published comics as well as  &quot;reprints&quot; of older comics. However, a full-page grid of panels is  not easily readable on the smaller screen of the typical smartphone, so the software  interfaces on such devices focus on a single panel at a time. The deliberate  juxtaposition of graphic and textual elements in the original composition is  shattered by the interface requirements and limitations of the reading device.  As new comics work is increasingly targeted at such digital platforms, <b>the traditional grouping of panels into  compositional units resembling pages may be abandoned for new compositional  strategies</b>.<br>

    <p> A large corpus of digitized comic books, along  with encoded transcriptions and descriptive metadata, would allow scholars to  search the text of comic books, search for keywords related to topics of  interest, search for the appearance of particular characters, or search for  works by particular writers and artists. Additionally, when exploited to its  full potential, a large CBML collection would allow searching - and other forms  of computer processing and computational analysis - based on structural,  aesthetic, and informational and documentary features peculiar to the genre of  comic books. This sort of functionality has proven incredibly useful and has  transformed the ways in which scholars and students conduct research and  &quot;read.&quot;</p>
    <p> Individual comic books and graphic narratives  may be better understood through strategies of close reading, with careful  attention paid to minute details of linguistic and visual language and document  features, but comic books as a system and extended comic book narratives - which  often unfold over decades in thousands or tens of thousands of individual  documents by hundreds of creators (writers and artists) - benefit also from the  distant reading (of text, image, and metadata) from comic book documents.<br>
