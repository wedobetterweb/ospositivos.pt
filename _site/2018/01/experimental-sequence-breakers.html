I Abstract Formalist Comics José Ja Ja Ja Frédérique Rusch Alexis Beauclair Stefanie Leinhos Abstract formalist comics indisputably and directly study the most fundamental formal elements of comics: time, image, space-time (image as time), repetition, perspective, language, and motion. They don’t necessarily lack representative objects; rather, the representative objects are treated as simply objects (which is not to say unsympathetically). What follows is that the &quot;narratives&quot; of these comics are more process than plot: they explore motion, transformation, growth, repetition, etc. As such, an abstract formalist comic might have human characters, but the emphasis is on the characters’ form as opposed to their psychology. Different narratives arise from the unity and disunity of visuals. in &quot;Case Study:Breaking the Sequence&quot; 17 out 2017 II Comics Poetry Aidan Koch Andrew Burkholder Jason Murphy Abstract formalist comics and comics poems often visually resemble each other, but unlike their wordless cousins, comics poems notably integrate text poetry with images.
