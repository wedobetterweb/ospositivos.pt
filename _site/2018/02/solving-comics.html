  <h1 class="centre">Introduction</h1>
  <p>THE book you hold in your hands, The Best American Comics 2017, offers conclusive evidence of the greatness of today's American comics. Although many of the cartoonists included in this anthology come from obscure ethnic backgrounds, they have all willingly jumped onboard the American train to glory. The comics industry under our present administration is booming — $1.03 billion in sales and growing! The cartoonists represented in this book are not only wonderful artist-authors, they are winning players in the casino of American culture. The image of the struggling alternative cartoonist living on ramen noodles and TV dinners is a thing of the past — today's cartoonist is <b>a successful artist-entrepreneur</b> negotiating multiple publishing and film deals, planning a line of toys and other merchandise, and <b>receiving literary and academic accolades while comfortably ensconced in an upper-middle-class, or higher, lifestyle</b> surrounded by loving family and jealous friends. Today's cartoonist stands firmly <b>with one foot planted in popular culture and the other in the blue-chip galleries and museums of the international art world</b>. The cartoonist's feet are bathed in<b> the twin revenue streams of low- and high-brow production</b>. From the innocent child to the doddering, gray-haired comics fan — everyone is a potential paying customer. Money needed for food and medical care is gladly diverted to buy a few moments of comic-strip bliss. <strong>Even the small-press publisher — once the laughingstock of the media world — feeds from the same trough as his big brothers in the world of multinational corporate media.</strong> That American comics have come to dominate the world's graphic-novel reading market is no accident. As an imperial military and economic power, the aura of American cultural products strikes both fear and admiration in the literate and illiterate peoples of the developing world. At the risk of drowning in provincialism, readers around the world must accommodate themselves to the consumption of American cultural products as they have since the end of the last great World War. The American sense of humor becomes their sense of humor; the American idea of comics becomes their idea of comics. The printing presses of Shenzhen and Shanghai are kept busy with American orders for cheap color printing. Cartoonists also play an important role in our current war efforts around the globe. Our courageous drone operators in their leisure time leave their joysticks behind to relax in the fantasy world of comics; teenagers are inculcated with the pleasures of victimless violence through our biggest-selling superhero comics. <strong>Even small press art-comics do their bit to help the war effort. Through the depoliticization of comics into an "art object," they encourage young readers to accept the eternal values of "fine art" and the status quo of a free American society.</strong> We salute their efforts! Regardless of your sexual orientation, your ethnic background, your religious delusions, or your dietary preferences, it's a great time to be an American cartoonist. </p></article>

<p class="centre"><small>...ainda da intro do <b><em>"Best American Comics 2017"</em></b></small></p>
  <p>Prosseguimos as mesma razões de todas as anteriores: a intersecção a tópicos que nos estão na ordem do dia. <em>Art et comics</em>, ainda. De ilustração / reforço ao nosso manifesto em <a href="https://www.ospositivos.com/2018/01/contemporaneidades.html">cultura de massas</a>, <a href="https://www.ospositivos.com/2018/01/a-margem.html">indústria de entretenimento</a>, <a href="https://www.ospositivos.com/2018/01/arty.html">$$$,</a> arte <em><a href="https://www.ospositivos.com/2018/01/ar-too.html">high &amp; low</a></em>, <a href="https://www.ospositivos.com/2018/01/inovacoes.html">tecnologias</a>, um <em>mashup</em>, com permissas e conclusões não muito diferentes das nossas.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When I was developing my interest in cartoon art, I was enrolled in college studying <b>painting and literature</b>. But I loved this idea of the <b>mass reproduction of artwork</b> that could live on a rack near a candy stand, and I didn't have nearly that same passion for the world of galleries and high modernist art. In the 1970s, it was difficult to publish such things because the literary world, the art world ... the people there were extremely suspicious of comics. We've yet to tackle all the ways that comics production can democratize the image. It's still not quite what I envisioned in my wildest dreams: racks next to candy stands <strong>filled with lots of diverse, intellectually compelling comics work, available at cheap, pulp-level prices to anyone seeking good art</strong>.<br>

    <p><b>There's been an explosion of work done in this form, a broader sense of what it can be used to accomplish, unlike the superheated market for so-called 'serious' art, and here you have all these talented creators trying to solve the problem of the comic strip.</b> <br>
